"This'll be a blast!"
"I'm going, I'm going."
"Anyone got a... match?"
"Come on... come on, come on!"
"Let's blow this joint."
"Hey... where'd that bomb go?"
"Don't worry, I got this."
"Impatient? I'm not impatient."
"I'm going, I'm going...!"
"I'll take this one, and this one, andâ€”throw it in your face!"
"I like my enemies, like I like my bombs: about to explode!"
"Fuses burning, fuses burning!"
"Explosion first, questions later."
"It's gonna blowwww!"
"I bring the Big One!"
"Ooh, look out below!"
Ziggs ponders curiously and then squeaks quietly and in thought. "Come on!" Finally, he rattles in frustration.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!".
Ziggs screams "Wh-ee-ee-ee... Uh-oh--"
"Gotta go yeah go now start yeah boom!"
"No no no no, I got my fuses crossed."
