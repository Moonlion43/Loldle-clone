"Fear not... I will make use of your corpse."
"I once had honor... before the Ruination."
"This land will never heal. But I will lay it to rest."
"Tired, ancient, and half-dead. Still, I come for you."
"I am the rift between life and death. The thin divide between breath and grave."
"Join us in eternity, Yorick."
"In the beyond, once you're free."
"Let us in, remove your chains."
"Yorick, look what you've become."
"I've become what I must be."
"Your human form is so confining. You could be infinite."
"We see you, Yorick. We know your weakness."
"I carry these souls to their end... wherever it may be."
"Tears of life preserve me."
"We shall prevail. We have eternity."
"Our souls are a small price to pay to cleanse this land."
"I remember when I put them in the ground."
"The Mist writhes, searching for a place to take root."
"It is to the grave, we go."
"The isles were once paradise; now they're a prison."
"This mist has become skin."
"Life is but a brief disinterment."
"The Ruined King's allies shall fall with him."
"My curse is our only hope."
"What hell is worse than this limbo?"
"I do not live in hope. I work to return it."
"The dead don't hear you, no matter how you cry."
"One can stare into the grave too long."
"Soon, this depravity will end."
"Remember my name. For one day, I will not."
"This journey is long, but I will complete it."
"These isles... how they scream."
"Tell me of the beyond... in case I never make it."
"Death is not to be feared."
"The dead have not forgotten."
"They once called these isles undying. Yet die, they will."
"From the ground they come, and to it, they return."
"All things fade... but me."
"The beyond is waiting. Strive to meet it."
"Everyone I knew is dead. How are things with you?"
"How quick the turn from blessed to cursed."
"Death used to mean something."
"Ours is a fate worse than death."
"I am no tyrant. These souls act on their own."
"Hallowed or profane... I no longer know."
"We're dead much longer than we are alive."
"I go wherever souls are adrift."
"The constant wailing of souls in torment."
"So many souls, so few bodies."
"It hurts to remember."
"What I do is just. Every horrid piece of it."
"What a beautiful dream is life."
"I do not know what lies beyond. But it is better than this."
"Water for the living, shovel for the dead."
"If they could see what I see, they'd long for death."
"To most, life is fleeting; to me, it is quagmire."
"Death is not always a release."
"The Ruined King will soon meet the victims of his curse."
"But for the waters, the mist would take me."
"I am the first and last of my order."
"Do you hear that? It is the end."
"I cling to life by the thinnest thread."
"The dead shall forgive me. I hope."
"They say I was once your age, though I can't quite recall."
"Your corpses against mine. May the best win."
"I have nothing but time. Show me something else."
"Those you ride down will soon rise against you."
"You and I share a common goal. The similarities end there."
"Enjoy this limbo while you can, for I will soon end it."
"One day, you will take me. May it be soon."
"I know you. And I see you always."
"No, Lucian, I haven't seen your wife."
"You remind me that the world is sometimes good... and very naive."
"I fight to free you as well, though a hatchet would suffice."
"My army will soon storm your gates, revenant."
"Yours is a fool's errand. The world must be allowed to die."
"You think you want immortality. I'll gladly give you mine."
"Those souls are not yours to keep."
"I pity what you have become. Shall I end your suffering?"
"Yours is an easy grave to dig, small one."
"You'll make a fine addition to my cloak."
"For you, I won't dig too deep."
"I no longer feel insults."
"I've endured more pain than any words can bring."
"I'm just happy to have company."
"Ah yes, I remember spewing idle words."
"Ah, missed it. There it goes! Where is it at— Ah! Yes!"
"Ah, would you like some friends? Nope, can't have 'em."
"I suppose I have eternity to think about that one."
"Ah yes, I remember what laughter sounds like."
"Prepare your epitaph."
"Scatter their remains."
"You are beyond saving."
"I will not damn you. I will end you."
"Respects to the dying."
"The beyond awaits you."
"The mist comes for you."
"The grave is your home."
"I'll mourn for you."
"Flesh that will soon find earth."
"You decay and do not know it."
"To dirt, you return."
"I need your essence, great beast."
"Your kind is supposed to live long. I am sorry."
"That is a lot of flesh to raise."
"Even your kind will join the mist."
"Yours will be the largest coffin."
"I shall perform your rites!"
"What's one more grave?!"
"The isles remember!"
"Die with me brothers, and be free."
"Some of these faces I know well."
"Ah yes, I remember you."
"This horde consumes all."
"I thank you for your service."
"Kill, and use its form."
"They rise, they fight, they rot."
"Arise and return to this world."
"A little longer, friend, then rest."
"Rest in your rightful place."
"It's good to see you."
"Wake up. You have a new task."
"Welcome back, you won't be here long."
"It's you they seek."
"The ruins of these isles rise to smite you."
"Won't you join them?"
"The damned resist their fate."
"To destroy the curse, I use it."
"They reach for you."
"A profane sacrament."
"An unholy mark upon you."
"It fouls upon touch."
"A curse upon the ground."
"Go, take what you will."
"Behold the horrors of the  Isles!"
"See the Maiden? She comes for you."
"The mist takes all!"
"More, more for the black maw of the mist!"
"We are not corruption. We are strength!"
"We devour it. It becomes us!"
"Do you feel it? I am more!"
"We are stronger. We shall take all!"
"One more step toward domination!"
"One more step toward the end."
"Your remains will serve a purpose."
"Another voice in the cacophony of wails."
"We all end the same."
"Flesh torn asunder, flesh reborn."
"Look at the wrong you do!"
"One more nail in the coffin of the  Isles."
"I can't bury them all."
"My graveyard is full."
"All these bodies going to waste."
"It falls, like all things."
"Makes its own tomb."
"Everything that stands must fall."
"Don't bury me with it. You can't take it with you."
"Even a monk needs bread and water."
"Material items, for the material world."
"The sword of a great man."
"The sword of a fool."
"The king will return for it."
"Then I will strike him down."
"The blade of the father."
"A tyrant who will pay for his crimes."
"This blade has performed great feats."
"And I will use it to undo them."
"A sack to cover flesh and bone."
"The armor of someone soon to die."
"I wouldn't be caught dead in that."
"Mere rags, soon to fade."
"The dead need no armor, but I do."
"Taken from one who can no longer use it."
"It fits me to perfection."
"Too valuable to bury."
"To slow the fleet of foot."
"Cold, even to my touch."
"As cold as the hand of death."
"Red is the heart that barely beats in me."
"It pulses with life, as the  Isles once did."
"Sometimes the dead can give life."
"A ghastly armament."
"A gift from kind specters."
"Stay with me, spirit."
"They'll find me hard to bury."
"A gauntlet to throw before the king."
"Gives life when death is near."
"To cremate my foes."
"The fire of life burns within."
"The only warmth I've found."
"I still draw breath."
"Even a monk needs respite."
"The bells toll and I respond."
"We all return to our origin."
"My path is a circle, my work never-ending."
"A breath between rites."
"You retreat like a coward."
"I will return anon."
"The shock of resurrection quickly passes."
"I've come too far to stay dead."
"We do not die, and so we fight on."
"When we end, we begin again."
"Revived by the tears of life."
"One day, I will no longer awaken."
"The beyond is not given. It is earned."
"Our time has not yet come."
"There will be no requiem. Not yet."
"A futile act—why do you persist?"
"We shall rise to this challenge."
"Victory... slips away."
