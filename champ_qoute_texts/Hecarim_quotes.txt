"Behold, the might of the Shadow Isles."
"Their souls beg for release."
"The shadow approaches."
"Your life is a burden. I bring you freedom!"
"You won't live to see your world destroyed."
"Another blue ribbon for Hecarim."
"Suffering is magic."
"Trample their bones."
"Crush them underfoot."
"The living will fall."
