"Know that if the tables were turned, I would show you no mercy!"
"Your commands tire me."
"'It's only a short way'? Is that a short joke?!"
"Your commands tire me."
"Stalking prey again?"
"The magic, it calls to me!"
"You deny the darkness in your soul! You deny your power!"
"What's black and blue and is about to show you the definition of pain?!"
"I can see the fear in your heart."
"Even now, your loved ones suffer!"
"Even death trembles in my presence."
"Your soul will come to serve me."
"I am evil! Stop laughing!"
"I will swallow your soul."
"This will be a short game! Wait..."
"No! No! No! This isn't over!"
