"All the world on one arrow."
"Coward! May you die with your eyes closed."
"Peace requires a steady hand."
"Do not confuse mercy for weakness."
"We will unite the  Freljord."
"Let's see how close they can get."
"Move quickly, position well, and the battle is won before blood is drawn."
"A battle worthy of the Freljord."
"Today, the fate of our people hangs in the balance."
"The Freljord shall unite!"
"My tribe will bring peace to the North! The South should fear us."
"I will show them the power of an Iceborn."
"We are all kin of kin. Blood, of blood."
"The day our tribes are one, the world will tremble."
"I am Freljordian. Family, tribe, they are all."
"I am a Warmother. I have given oaths to few. I have taken oaths from many."
"Seek peace, but bring the tools of war."
"The bow is my will given form: I am it; it is me."
"No fate is written, except by us."
"Gods and spirits guide us. But our lives... are our own."
"There will be peace in the Freljord. I will forge it."
"My people know only cold and hardship... I will teach them peace."
"I hold a bow of True Ice. I hold my heart."
"Hearthbound and Iceborn; Spirit Walker and Fireborn; all Freljordians are my kin."
"I was born into poverty—all Freljordians are."
"I will not allow us to be divided. We are one."
"They think me cold. I have seen things the Southerners cannot imagine."
"What is goodness but trying to do better than your forebears?"
"The ice is not pain, it is surrender."
"Together, we are strong. Together, we are...  Avarosan."
"I do not seek the throne of Avarosa."
"I dream of a nation for my people."
"When I say Avarosa, I hear my mother, and her dreams..."
"Glory to the  Volibear, the Thousand-Pierced Beast. Give my people the resilience of your wilderness and the fury of your storm."
"Praise  Ornn, the Firebringer. I ask for your wisdom, First Builder and Forgelord."
"Praise  Anivia, the Frostbringer. Let us feel the coming of change. Grant us the freedom to travel in safety."
"Praise  Kindred, the Two Hunters. Pray we see death's approach, so we may complete our labors and die with our eyes open."
"Bless us,  Ildhaurg, Warden of Sacrifice. Protect my  husband. Protect my people. If my death pleases you, let it sustain my tribe."
"Hmph, 'destiny'. I have always hated that word. It is a wyrm that ruins lives and murders innocence. It is a deceiver and bringer of woe."
"I have heard no better words than 'The strong must try the impossible.' This is the oath I must fulfill."
"We praise the leader who unifies, forgetting it is only the unity that matters."
"What is it to lead? It is to lie. It is to preach caution even when you are elated. It is to give hope even when you feel none."
"You do not aim a bow at the target, you fire knowing where the target will be. This, is vision."
"In the North, a great chieftain is called 'Warmother.' Who but a mother has the right to risk lives in war?"
"I am a Warmother—a chieftain—only because no one else will do what must be done."
"I loved my mother. I loved my battlesister. I love my people. It is because of this love that I fight."
"I dream of the day after the tribes are unified. I dream of no longer needing to lead."
"Clan or tribe, they will join us. This is the will of Avarosa."
"It is not the goddess Avarosa's glory I wish to recapture; it is our people's."
"Avarosan is the tribe of many, because all Freljordians are one people."
"Avarosa speaks one truth, as all gods must. She is our dream of unity."
"The goddess Avarosa... I say I hear her voice. But I hear only my mother's; and mourn her passing."
"My mother loved me. She fought and died trying to give me a better life. So I fight, and will die fighting, to give all Avarosans a better life."
"The Three Sisters are a myth that has strangled our people. It is a tale of failure."
"Know this! I am Ashe! I am the bow!"
"I am Ashe, Daughter of  Grena! Warmother of the Avarosans!"
"Prepare yourself, you face an Iceborn!"
"Anivia, how often have I sought your guidance? And how like a god to betray a mortal's trust!"
"Braum! What are you doing over there?! Are you drunk?"
"So, Braum. No shirt, huh? And I don't have pants. Yay, Freljord."
"Braum, we are a winter people from a frozen land. So we must... pop it, pop it!"
"Gragas! Are you blind?! You're on the wrong side... again!"
"Lissandra, the fate of our people hangs in the balance, and you betray me?!"
"You named me battlesister and kin, Sejuani. Do not make me fight you!"
"So, which one is the pig? Kidding!"
"Trolls are the enemy of mankind! You will die like a beast!"
"Tryndamere...? What have you become?!"
"How do you like the curves? I was talking about the bow."
"Shaman, I am no enemy of the old gods or Sejuani! Must we fight?"
"Ancient one, go! The Volibear is honored here, but unwanted!"
"Yay, Freljord! Did any of us get cold-weather clothes?!"
"Take a good look; it's the last you'll get."
"This is the latest in Freljordian fashion. They call it a... skirt."
"This outfit makes total sense, just look closer and think about it... less."
"No, really, put that apple on your head... Ooh! Gah... Ahh. Ohh... hmm..."
"I don't have to see you to shoot you... Ah, ow! Ugh, oh. Really?!"
"Hahaha! Check this out... Agh! Ugh, who makes a bow out of ice?!"
"You face an Iceborn!"
"Feel winter's sting."
"I was raised for war! I am Iceborn."
"Hmph, the cold does not forgive."
"You would challenge an Iceborn?"
"I greet you; as a Freljordian!"
"My mercy has limits!"
"This is my warning to you...!"
"Fate will treat you coldly!"
"Never. Lose. Focus!"
"I do my best work from afar."
"Flee from the cold."
"You face true ice—you face death."
"Fate did not choose you."
"As ice shatters, so shall you!"
"My arrows fly true."
"I will face you, sister."
"This is the fury of an Iceborn!"
"Faster than my arrows? I think not!"
"Reveal what is hidden."
"Spirit, reveal our way."
"All that frost touches, we know."
"I only needed one shot."
"Right between the eyes."
"No sagas will mark their passing."
"Mark where they died; that was as close as they got."
"They fought an Iceborn, they died."
"You fought an Iceborn! Death was the only possible outcome."
"Heh. Svaag, I have seen babies fight better than you!"
"Svaag, warmblood, was that your best? I killed you without trying."
"Are all southerners so weak?"
"No one escapes my aim."
"No one escapes my bow."
"No one escapes winter."
"Sejuani...! Goodbye, sister."
"Die, troll. My tribe will destroy your foul race!"
"Tryndamere, my love. I always suspected this would be our end."
"May the voices quiet for you, shaman."
"Man no longer needs the Volibear. Return, and I will slay you again."
"Do your ancestors proud."
"I will face you, sister!"
"A battle worthy of Freljord."
