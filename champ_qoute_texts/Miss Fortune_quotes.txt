"Fortune doesn't favor fools."
"You've got dangerous eyes... I like that."
"Sure you can handle me, summoner?"
"I know what I'm doing."
"I've got a good feeling about this."
"Watch your mouth, kid, or you'll find yourself respawning at home!"
"How do you like my guns... Shock, and Awe!"
"I always shoot first."
"Nothing but powder monkeys."
"Who will fortune favor today?"
"Get those  oranges ready, Gangplank!"
"Don't get cocky. I'll be back!"
