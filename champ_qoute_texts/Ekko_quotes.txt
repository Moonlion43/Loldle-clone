"It's not how much time you have, it's how you use it."
"You used to be cool."
"Someone's day's about to get wrecked."
"Time to start some trouble."
"Ah… that fresh start smell."
"Zaun is the future."
"I owe them nothing."
"Time doesn't heal all wounds."
"Every second matters."
"Tomorrow's the last of my worries."
"No one keeps me down."
"I do my own stunts."
"Things aren't gonna improve themselves."
"Doubt me. I love that."
"I hate being responsible."
"I'd rather make mistakes than make nothing at all."
"Not quitting until it's right!"
"My pasts have a way of catching up."
"There are always consequences."
"If there are limits… I haven't found them yet."
"Never had luck. Never needed it."
"I finish what I start."
"Patience? What's that?"
"Every rule needs a break."
"Let's make them notice."
"Progress doesn't belong to one city."
"Back to going forward."
"Fool me once… and I'll just rewind."
"We make the future."
"Scared of a little revolution, Caitlyn?"
"Aw… who called the cops?"
"Go where you want, Mundo... outside of Zaun."
"Garen, shouted any good names lately?"
"I like you better on paper, poster boy."
"I'll never be like this guy."
"Nice face. Shame if something happened to it."
"I had a crush… until you started talking to the gun."
"You give Zaun a bad name."
"I lost a pet rat once. Is that you, Mr. Tails?"
"Take my time machine, Urgot. You clearly need it more."
"I'll poke your eye out… head out… face off? How do you even work?"
"You used to be cool."
"You forgot your roots, Vi."
"You're everything wrong with Zaun."
"Never go full robot."
"I'll never be like this guy."
"I really hope you're not the future me."
"You're in the wrong neighbourhood."
"Run away, little Piltie!"
"Last warning: go home."
"See? You're part of the problem!"
"Think you're Zaun? Prove it."
"Zaun's future's about to get brighter."
"I already calculated your odds. Sorry."
"Won this fight already. Doing it again for fun."
"I've seen your future, and it's got broken bones."
"You'll always be Zaun to me."
"One day, you'll come back to Zaun."
"So, uh… how about that weather?"
"Let me be honest, I have no idea what I'm doing."
"Time scramble doesn't travel my brain."
"Uh… if anyone sees my paradox, ask 'im where I am."
"This is the longest second of my life."
"The timeline was already this broken when I found it. I swear."
"How many Pilties does it take to make a hammer? — All of 'em! Hehe…"
"How many Pilties does it take to make a hammer? — Two, if you count Jayce's reflection! Haha! Oh, Jayce."
"How many Pilties does it take to make a hammer? — Zero! They make 'em in Zaun!"
"This is how we say 'hello' in Zaun."
"Good a time as any to act reckless."
"I'll help you this time. Duck."
"Come on! Show me something new!"
"All out of warnings."
"Time is not on your side!"
"I like hitting you!"
"Last chance to be anywhere else."
"Haha… you never see this coming."
"Should've walked away."
"Make me repeat myself!"
"I could make this hurt less."
"We'll do it the hard way!"
"Reversing polarity!"
"Gotta do better than that, law dog!"
"Were you trying to hit me?"
"Next time, shoot where I'm gonna' be!"
"Swing and a miss, top hat!"
"I'm old enough to buy this."
"A second chance? I thought I was on my fifth!"
"I'm sure I won't be needing this… but I'll take it anyhow."
"Yep, put an angel on the job. I could use a break."
"I love hitting Pilties with their own toys."
"All in. Just my style."
"Let's go hunt some liches?"
"That is one big tooth."
"And I'm fighting with teeth."
"Rabadon must've been a fun guy."
"Not much of a hat guy… but this thing is awesome!"
"Three forces at work."
"This thing creeps me out."
"Can't hide your weak spots from me!"
"Some things do get better with time."
"Yep, this thing has a bright future."
"It's like it was made for me."
"How can I not buy this?"
"Huh. Freezing time. Interesting."
"Stops time? Huh. Thought I'd never get a break."
"You gotta teach me that trick, Zil!"
"I coulda survived that— but thanks anyway."
"Back before anyone notices."
"I need to rethink a couple things."
"They'll wish I stayed here."
"Second first time for everything!"
"That worked in another timeline."
"Let's not do that again."
"Yep… that went exactly how I didn't want it to go."
"Back to square seven."
"Note to self: don't touch cop's hat."
"Note to self: hammer is actually a gun."
