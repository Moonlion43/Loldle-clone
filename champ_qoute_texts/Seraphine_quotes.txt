"Let's change the world!"
"I sing to help them find themselves. The stage just makes it easier."
"Everything sings to me! I've gotta sing it all back."
"It can't be as simple as us versus them. I know if I sing loud enough, they'll listen!"
"Wow. All these songs sound amazing. I'll bring them into harmony!"
"When I'm on stage, I feel complete. I wanna help everyone find that peace."
"Hello, world! I'm Seraphine, and you are beautiful!"
"Everyone's singing the same song and they don't even know it!"
"Come for the show, stay for the message."
"Music helps you keep your head up."
"Folks only love a reflection when it isn't theirs."
"I wonder what I sound like outside my head."
"People don't always listen, but that's no reason to keep quiet."
"Joy's too quiet without sorrow on the downbeat."
"Even in my dreams I hear them sing."
"It's harder to stumble on this stage, but it sure does hurt more."
"Couldn't lose the rhythm if I tried!"
"Hope I don't get lost in all this music!"
"Lookin' for a song in everything I meet!"
"Haven't heard a soul that wasn't at least a little raw."
"Easier to hear someone else than to hear yourself."
"Stage fright? Never heard of it."
"You can't keep your song inside."
"Everyone's got their own muse. Mine's... everyone!"
"Everyone fights to be heard. I'll fight to listen."
"Not sure where I'm going. Can't wait to find out!"
"Gotta keep moving with the music!"
"Nothing better than a good song!"
"Maybe the world's not ready for me. I don't mind waiting!"
"Making it up as I go!" Seraphine sings.
"Hear the world in my voice!"
"Don't mistake me for my lyrics."
"Gotta find the rhythm in the chaos."
"Some songs start with a rhyme, some with a rhythm... Mine, starts with the crowd."
"We fight for our lives every day. Every one of us."
"We get as close to death as we can to feel alive."
"We're all looking for meaning, even after we've found it."
"Cities have songs too. Zaun and Piltover sing together in a dazzling duet."
"Even if I heard every song, it would never be enough."
"Breathe with your belly, breathe with your belly... Gah! Breathing is hard."
"Moods are like melodies. They go up, they go down, and sometimes, they surprise!"
"One day, the music will stop. Better dance while you can!"
"I have this feeling like I'm yearning for something I've lost. One day, I'll catch it in a song."
"For the longest time, I couldn't hear myself over the crowd. So, I made them part of me!"
"Pilties say a new idea is just seven old ones all mixed up. That's kinda how my songs work."
"Wow! We've only just met, and I'm already inspired."
"I'll fight if you make me, but we could sing instead!"
"Aw, how can I say anything bad about a fan? Come on, make some noise!"
"Can't wait to write a song about this moment!"
"Hey! Wanna hear your song?"
"Azir, lemme try. Shurima!" Seraphine giggles.
"Camille! Sorry, but you're the only one marching to your drum."
"No one keeps time like you, Ekko."
"Such a perfect four-four! But also... so wrong!"
"Whoa! I can't follow your song at all, and I... love it!"
"Lux, your song sounds like a rainbow!"
"Wow! You sing in such color, Neeko!"
"Oh, Sona, your song is so... wow!"
"Hey, Vi! Wrote you a fight song. Bet you'd love it."
"Do you make carpets? Because you are cutting that rug!"
"How about a call and response?"
"Sometimes music hurts."
"This beat's got a kick!"
"Listen to yourself!"
"This one's for you!"
"The stage is yours!"
"You're all breathtaking!"
"Sit down and listen up!"
"Love a captive audience!"
"Whole world hears me now!"
"Your turn to shine!"
"Nobody can truly silence you. Not even me."
"Thanks for listening!"
"I expect an encore!"
"You can't let that be your swan song."
"One-two-three, one-two-three..."
"Was that... my first hater?"
"There's nothing we can't do together!"
"Runnin' out of steam!"
"Could use a partner for this next verse!"
"Careful! Let's play it slow!"
"Huh. My audience disappeared."
"Headin' your way. Get ready to rock!"
"That's the end of this performance. Encore's comin' up!"
"You've all been a wonderful audience. Thank you!"
"Next time, I wanna see all of you on stage!"
"Could've been worse. Could've, um... forgotten the words."
"Tough crowd! Maybe it's time to change my tune."
"Ready to sing again!"
"All right, Sera, no big deal. Pretend it's a rehearsal."
"Hm... Think they wanna hear more? Of course they do!"
"Gonna write a kicker out of that one."
