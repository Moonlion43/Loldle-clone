"You may now appreciate me."
"You are right to fear my greatness."
"Oh, good, servants. Carry my panoply to the battle, would you?"
"Cover the ground behind me. None may tread where I have stepped."
"I would say 'watch and learn,' but unfortunately you cannot learn this."
"I don't mean to sound arrogant, but I'm extremely good, at everything."
"I can tell by your expressions you've never met a superior being."
"I'm through being an NPC! From now on, I make the decisions."
"I will take my rightful place, ruling all Arcadia, from the home base to the majestic mountains where they stopped coding."
"I am the true ultimate boss. All other bosses are just side quests."
"I hear this game has a beautiful amazingly talented boss at the end, and her name is Qiyana."
"Congratulations, you have Qiyana. The other side, they have no Qiyana."
"It's not a ring blade, it's an ohmlatl! Idiots."
"Ee-shao-can! They will all learn to say it."
"Some wait their turn, and some take what they deserve."
"There will always be someone who is better, and that person is me."
"I'm getting hot. Where is my royal fanner?!"
""Let's see, what can someone do for me."
"One throne, nine sisters. Nine tragic accidents waiting to happen."
"My enemies try their best. That is what is so sad."
"Of course I've mastered fire... I just don't like to show off."
"I'm not arrogant, I'm right."
"In Ixtal we call them 'cao-mul': soon to be mud."
"This place will be a lovely addition to my empire."
"My feet cannot step where lesser beings have tread."
"I hate it when they dare look me in the eye."
"I will grant this place the privilege of being conquered by me."
"If they want to worship me... hmph, I will not stop them."
"'Empress Qiyana...' I do like the sound of that."
"Being young means living to see all your enemies die first."
"Some people are just born better."
"The secrets of my enemies carry far on the wind."
"Ugh, this place could use some reshaping."
"Line them up. I will bend their knees."
"Things do what I tell them to. Right, rocks?"
"If talent were an element, perhaps I could throw some at them."
"No more hiding in the wilderness. I demand to be seen!"
"You know what's hard about being a princess? Nothing."
"Hard work is for those who possess no talent."
"My parents rule with fairness and compassion. So boring."
"Those who find Ixtal do not live to speak of it."
"It is a travesty to not be carried by servants."
"I do not lack empathy. Other people just need to be better."
"I cannot wait to be empress. If only my entire family were not in the way."
"If I command the rivers to flow backward, they shall."
"I name this the River Qiyana."
"The perfect place to dispose of my enemies."
"I know what they are thinking: "There goes Qiyana! She is so much better than all nine of her sisters; I can't believe she's not our queen."
"We should throw a feast for me, but we'll need something to celebrate. I know! Let us crush the enemy!"
"Someday, all this will be Ixaocan. A glorious empire, with an empress to fit."
"I am the shaper of lands, and who are you? A nobody."
"The rocks don't like you, the plants don't like you, and I'm pretty sure I don't like you."
"There are levels to this competition. Better stay on yours."
"How proud you are of your abilities, like an ape who just found a stick."
"Why are you in my space? I cannot be seen with the likes of you."
"Please, lizard, you cannot copy perfection."
"Why yes, I believe I will throw another rock."
"The jungle obeys me, Zyra. In time, you will do the same."
"You dare raise a hand against your rightful ruler? Estem qa'eve!"
"I have a message for you to spread to everyone in your... Pil-tover."
"Magic from machines? How cheap and distasteful."
"You Pilt-ovans are like flying squirrels pretending to soar like the eagles."
"I have great plans for Shurima, starting with you."
"We have the great city of Ixaocan. What does your Shurima have? Sand and ghosts."
"You only know one element? How quaint."
"Commanding just one element must be quite dull. Then again, it's so you!"
"Impressive magic. Did you buy that at a discount?"
"Your magic is so primitive. Just like your sense of style."
"Aww, your primitive magic is adorable."
"First time seeing real magic? I'll go slowly so you may follow along."
"I can see your weakness; it is just, well, all of you."
"I have humiliated my own sisters. What do you think I'll do to you?"
"I see you have mastered the element of wind."
"I claim—" Qiyana hiccups. "Claim this land for Ixao—" Qiyana hiccups again. "I WILL CLAIM THIS LAND FOR IXAOCAN!"
"Look around, so many ways to kill you."
"I love your little weapons."
"You're going to die looking like that?"
"Why do you not grovel?"
"Jaw-dropping, I know."
"Losing is your element."
"Here! You're used to failure."
"This is beneath me."
"I command you to die!"
"Don't walk where I walk."
"You presume too much."
"What do you think you're doing?!"
"Nuh-uh. You've got to go."
"Here's some advice: quit!"
"Don't bring that trash over here."
"Say 'ring blade' one more time...!"
"Bow your head or lose it!"
"Hope you brought a cheat code."
"Oh grass, please hide me from these imbeciles."
"I do look good in green."
"Brings out my eyes."
"They'll never see me coming. What a shame."
"This will grow on the graves of my enemies."
"As green as the envy of my sisters."
"Freeze them in their place!"
"Wet, like the tears of my enemies."
"Drown them, freeze them, watch them sink."
"That chill in the air? It's me."
"They always said I was cold."
"The best thing about water? My reflection."
"So many rocks, so many enemies."
"Rock is so common. Just like them."
"Stone, the foundation of empires."
"See? The land knows it is mine."
"Oh rock, smash these idiots, won't you?"
"Rejoice! You are now part of the legend of Qiyana!"
"You're welcome. Next!"
"Not my fault. They should have bowed."
"If you bleed on me, I'll kill you again!"
"Ha! You even die ugly."
"Who were you again?"
"That's where you belong. In the dirt."
"Could someone dispose of these corpses?"
"Failure, failure, failure, failure, failure."
"It is exhausting to crush you so much!"
"Excuse me! ...Uh, excuse me?! Ugh. When I return, this place better have a statue of me."
"Grass? Oh grass? Take me away from this tiresome battle. And can you also fan me?"
"Servants, my palanquin. Servants? Ugh, must I do everything myself?"
"Hello? Qiyanalings? Carry my digital palanquin, would you? Thanks."
"Oh, mini bosses? The real boss needs to be carried. Yes, thank you."
"Oh tiny pixelated people? Yes, whatever you are, get me out of here please."
"Nobody... touch my stuff..."
"But I'm too amazing to die..."
"Put a monument... here..."
"Can't keep me in the ground. The ground obeys me."
"See? Even death is no match for Qiyana."
"I suppose they will make me do this the hard way."
"Did anyone see that? Well, I'll just have to kill them."
"That was no crushing; that was merely a squeeze."
"I say give them a win. They're so cute when they think they have a chance."
"It's not dying, it's restarting from the last checkpoint."
