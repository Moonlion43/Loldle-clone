"See with eyes unclouded."
"I'd rather be home anyway."
"Unless you know anything about spirits or the Spirit Realm, you'd do well to let me focus on my work."
"Do any of you wanna talk about spirits? ...I'll assume that's a yes!"
"I have my book, my wand, my starting supplies... Do I need anything else? Okay... Let's go!"
"This region is teeming with wayward spirits. I'll find and help them all."
"Just so you all know, I'll be focused on my research. You can expect to receive my notes once I'm done."
"Spending time with others is exhausting. If I seem curt, don't take it personally."
"The worst fate for a  Demi-god is to be forgotten. I won't let that happen to Haestryr."
"It's such a relief to have you here, Ramhaurg. Our other colleagues are so... loud."
"Spirit walker; I'm looking forward to working with you again. I'll show you what I've learned."
"Ooh, another spirit! Wow, look at you! Oh... you're going that way? Okay, we'll talk later!"
"Spirits are so lucky they're not people."
"I quite enjoy my own company!"
"Oh! I've read about this!"
"So few see the world as I do."
"The sounds, the smells... I hate it."
"The spirits here are different from the ones in the  Freljord."
"The spiritual balance here is... off."
"I woke up early for this..."
"I should write home. So my... family knows I'm still alive."
"I like when it's quiet — I can hear myself think."
"Auntie Havu would like it here. She loves drama."
"I go where my research takes me."
"How can anyone be afraid of ghosts? They're adorable!"
"Haestryr, my friend... I'll do all I can to help you."
"Weaknesses can also be strengths."
"I see, I see... very interesting."
"Would anyone notice if I just... left."
"Fascinating! I'll review this later."
"I see the Spirit Realm and material realm simultaneously — this blended world is my own... and it's beautiful."
"Spirits become wayward by absorbing the pain of mortals. It's my job to cleanse what each wisp has endured."
"I want to help Haestryr more than anything, but I'm not strong enough... yet."
"I won't let the Demi-gods, old and forgotten, lose their way because of the  Frostguard's lies."
"The Spirit Realm, the material realm... they aren't mirror images, but two halves of one existence."
"So little is documented about the Spirit Realm — my work will help others understand what they can't see!"
"No one is ever truly alone: spirits are all around us!"
"You know, technically, we're never more than five steps from a spirit."
"This is far too much walking."
"It seems we're temporary collaborators. I know just the topic to... WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!"
"My work is at a critical juncture, so this interruption is not ideal."
"Oh, you're interested in spirits? I have so much to share! Where do I start..."
"I've exceeded my capacity for social interaction today...!"
"Ysjarn, I've been searching for you. My friend Haestryr, he needs your help."
"Ashe, you want to bridge the  Freljord's divide. But unity isn't harmony."
"You're not human. But... you're not a spirit either. You are however... Very loud."
"Nagakabouros is your god, right? I'd love to know more."
"Wolf and Lamb... I didn't think I'd meet you so soon!"
"You are no witch, Lissandra. You're a disease."
"Same hat? Same hat."
"Well met, Ramhaurg! I have so much to share with you since we last spoke!"
"I recognize those ravens. Are you their owner? Or, do they own you?"
"We meet again, spirit walker. Care to catch up after this?"
"I can feel you trying to invade my mind, Valhir. Cut it out...!"
"You stain your blade with spirits, Yone! Why hurt what you can heal?"
"I'm something of a witch myself, you know!"
"The pain you carry... I've never seen anything like it."
"This is the culmination of my research." Aurora raises her voice in determination. "Spirit friend... I can help you!"
"A yordle!! I've never seen one in the material realm before!
"I accept myself as I am. What's your excuse?"
"What an 'interesting' thing to say out loud."
"Ta-da! Hilarious, right?"
"That had the components of a joke, but... it wasn't funny."
"All together now...!"
"Interesting choice."
"This is field research!"
"I have better things to do!"
"Let's get this over with!"
"You're angering the spirits!"
"Teach me something new."
"Respect my boundaries."
"You're in my personal space."
"Follow me. I'll help you."
"Hope you don't mind the detour!"
"You'll be safe with me."
"I appreciate the company."
"Let me guide you home."
"Hello, little spirit."
"With eyes unclouded."
"Through the looking glass!"
"One realm, to another!"
"My worlds converge!"
"You're in my realm now!"
"Bookmarked for later study."
"Enough of that, thank you."
"Well, that was a waste of my time."
"You'll enjoy being a spirit, it's nice."
"Knowledge is power... Try reading a book."
"I lost my train of thought."
"Ysjarn, be reborn. Haestryr and I will find you again."
"Ashe, your ideas may be noble, but your execution is lacking."
"Thank you, Illaoi. I'll be adding the  Serpent Isles to my list."
"I'll tell you when I'm ready to go, Kindred."
"Lissandra — I'll heal what you've defiled."
"We'll talk later, Ramhaurg!"
"See you again soon, spirit walker! I always appreciate our repartee."
"Your feral nature doesn't scare me, Valhir."
"Killing spirits will never bring you peace, Yone."
"Where do yordles go when they die...? Back to  Bandle City?"
"I can still help...! Let me organize my notes, and we can try again."
"Ah, finally! Now where was I?"
"Clearly not one of  Ramhaurg's works."
"These turrets are not conducive to my work."
"That was... easy. Who constructed this?"
"Goodbye, little friend."
"So strange, yet so cute."
"Everything is so... expensive. Explain."
"No, I am not interested in purchasing any carrots."
"Give me a second to decompress."
"The material realm is such an eye strain... One moment, I need a change of scenery."
"Haestryr... I'm s-... sorry..."
"Back to the Spirit Realm..."
"That was... not ideal; but I won't let this derail me."
"Note to self: repeating previous actions may lead to unfavorable results."
"Okay, back to work! The spirits here still need me."
"Oh, we're not done? ...We're still fighting? ...Okay."
