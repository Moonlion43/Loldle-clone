"In carnage, I bloom, like a flower in the dawn."
"My genius will be understood—eventually."
"And now, the curtain rises."
"This stage is beneath my talent, but I shall elevate it."
"Our performance begins."
"I suppose I must make do with this tawdry setting."
"I will bring them an opera of death."
"I serve a discerning clientele."
"Let's start the show."
"Death is certain, but killing doesn't have to be ugly."
"An icon doesn't have to explain himself."
"Behind every mask… is another mask."
"I can't live without the euphoria of performance."
"My genius will be understood - eventually."
"I shall choreograph this affair."
"Art requires a certain cruelty."
"It's very simple - when I shoot, they dance."
"My work asks questions, it never has answers."
"Which is the lie? The mask, or my face?"
"The trigger on a loaded weapon… it whispers for us to act."
"A costume, some makeup, a spray of blood."
"If I keep getting interrupted, how can I be expected to work?"
"I… orchestrate death."
"I will not suffer this ugliness."
"My audience awaits."
"The work is what matters."
"Art should terrify."
"I am the singer without a voice. The dancer without legs."
"I never hurt anyone. It is the performance that kills."
"I envy silence… because I must be loud."
"Happiness… is a warm gun."
"This performance needs more… zazz."
"They call me mad. All artists are mad."
"I must wait until the composition is perfect."
"My critics are… usually short-lived."
"My clients expect the best."
"I am at my best only during the performance."
"Mmm… the ecstasy of killing."
"The ecstasy of opening night."
"This would be easier if blood came in more colours."
"If I get this outfit dirty, I'm going to be so annoyed."
"The moment before the shot… is painful."
"My talent justifies all actions."
"Until they stop me, I will keep going."
"It's so difficult to work under these conditions."
"It is only when the gun fires that I am alive."
"I like a violent composition."
"I am pure. My work is pure."
"I want to feel everything. The gun makes it so I do."
"There is nothing for me but this."
"Only to the audience do I show my true face."
"The world is cruel. It does not have to be ugly."
"No poet's words could match my craft."
"My theater is the mind."
"I cannot be good. I must be perfection."
"This art is a compulsion. I cannot resist it."
"Death should never be quick. It should be an opera."
"They will dance, they will sing, they will die!"
"I swear each performance is the last, but I lie every time."
"Yes, the gun is ironic."
"Everyone wears a mask. I just chose to create my own."
"I get nervous before every performance, but I need that feeling."
"Perfection isn't good enough."
"They're puppets. I pull their strings, and then they dance."
"Art must exist beyond reason."
"Each bullet is a piece of my soul. Each shot is a piece of me."
"I provide catharsis for my clients, and my victims."
"I wonder what they think when they see me."
"I am a slave to this passion."
"I'm misunderstood. Beauty can't be evil."
"Every element must be in place."
"What sweet sadness is killing?"
"I was paid to put on a killer show."
"The end is important in all things."
"Wait for your cue! You're only here to herald my entrance."
"What a terrible arrangement."
"You shoot to kill, you better hit the heart."
"You shout and throw machetes? How quaint."
"I find your work very, very… obvious."
"Clearly you've never performed in Ionia."
"The always-enchanting tale of star-crossed lovers."
"Here's the thing, I don't need your god, I need more time for my production."
"There is such a thing as 'too much gold', my dear."
"I thought diamonds were a girl's best friend."
"When you speak, I don't hear god, I hear an idiot babbling."
"You can take my soul… if you'll shut up."
"So many guns, all lacking in meaning or artistry."
"Your finale will be a duet."
"Your story is revenge with guns and ghosts. How droll."
"While you're here, consider a wardrobe upgrade."
"I suppose you embody a primitive minimalism, but you lack my technique."
"Your father was a merciful man. Only his failure will be remembered."
"You helped lock me away. You tried to stop my work. My art cannot be contained."
"I have been planning your final performance for a very… long… time."
"I remember your father! He thought he could censor me."
"Your father's death denied me a performance. You will be his stand-in."
"Break a leg! Hehe, oh. 'Break a leg', hehe… ah, delightful. I do cut myself up."
"Your music lacks the cruelty of a masterpiece."
"Step out of my light! They call it background music!"
"Your work will be forgotten. I am ahead of my time!"
"You should learn the power of silence."
"You have too many lines."
"Oh, before you ask, yes, your whole ensemble makes you look fat. Very fat."
"Why would anyone listen to a creature so ugly?"
"How inelegant your words are. Surely a fool wrote your script."
"Heh… hehe… that hat is ridiculous, now… who let you wear that horrible thing?"
"An understudy can't upstage me."
"You were wrong to kill your master. I needed him for this performance."
"You belong in the shadows. No audience could love you."
"I remember your master. He was worth remembering."
"I offer an exclusive service. You'll find I murder the competition."
"You think you can stop my performance?"
"You wanted to kill me back then, didn't you? You will learn - art cannot be killed."
"I am avant-garde - you are stuck in the past."
"The Noxian invasion should be a wake-up call. We need more elaborate productions."
"You only understand harmony. Discord is required for contrast."
"My dear countryman, you remind me how little our culture has advanced."
"I do what others will not. That alone is innovation."
"How gauche your nation is."
"Your war was an impressive production, but it lacked soul."
"Your people mistake loudness for import."
"I've been asked to do so many boring performances in your nation."
"Noxians treat killing as a sport. It is an art."
"You are mediocrity. My genius will supplant you."
"I have elaborate plans for you."
"You lack imagination."
"Killing you will be one of my finest works."
"Only my actions will make you memorable."
"I've outdone myself this time."
"Art is worth the pain."
"They're gonna live, until they die."
"The show never ends!"
"This is your curtain call."
"There is no drama in a peaceful death!"
"Symmetry is so boring."
"Each bullet will be a dance."
"Places everyone, places!"
"Watch my puppets dance."
"When they find you, they will cry."
"Smiles, everyone, smiles!"
"I couldn't miss your performance."
"Your life had no value before me."
"You will be poetry."
"You will be beautiful."
"Each bullet is a song."
"The composition needs something."
"I will touch your heart."
"How can we make this fresh?"
"I will make you famous."
"This is my calling."
"Bliss comes only in the moment before I fire."
"Through my work, you shall transcend."
"You will learn what beauty truly is."
"One, two, three, four, two, two, three, four."
"There is art here, waiting."
"Smile! Everyone is watching!"
"Breathe in the atmosphere."
"This… passion… compels me."
"I live for the applause, you will die for it."
"Life has no meaning, but your death shall."
"Face the crowd, and bleed for them."
"Now that is what I want to see."
"The face of your killer is identical to mine."
"Art shall blossom from your fear."
"With my technique, killing blooms into artwork!"
"You've awoken something deep inside me."
"I knew you would find your mark, eventually."
"Your final scene begins."
"Prepare… for your finale."
"People scare better when they're dying."
"The truth comes only at the moment of dying."
"It's better to be above ground doing this than below ground doing nothing."
"I like the way you die, boy."
"It's fun to kill a man, to take all that he had, and could ever have."
"Kill Noxians and get paid for it? What's not to like?"
"I love to perform, but I hate crowds."
"These were clearly designed by a caveman."
"I have a thirst for melodrama."
"Red is a primary color."
"We all wear masks. Mine are just better-crafted."
"The essence of a thing is found only in its absence."
"I always execute with style."
"Gold is my power colour."
"Ionian footwear. Sadly, so obvious."
"I prefer my equipment to make a bang."
"Sometimes, silence is loud."
"Not sure I needed another mask, but oh well."
"Art is such a fickle thing."
"It is by my will alone I set my mind in motion."
"I do prefer my work to have a brisk tempo."
"Start the music. I will make them dance."
"The storm is in their hearts. I calm them."
"That delightful moment before the curtain goes up."
"In carnage, I bloom, like a flower in the dawn."
"I have risen from the filth and muck. I am the lotus blossom. I am beauty."
