"Listen here, people: I'm not here to clean up your messes! This is a lamp, not a mop!"
"If you get lost, look for my light! Unless, of course, it's lodged in somebody's skull."
"Bearing the Light of  Icathia in a run-of-the-mill lantern? Just my style."
"A battle, here? Huh, I thought they'd never ask!"
"Word o' wisdom to the rest of ya: the secret to a long life? Not dying."
"Could go for a boiled egg right about now."
"Old man with a lamp, comin' through!"
"Last light of Icathia, first line of defense."
"Might have to make another heroic last stand!"
"Nothing wrong with a life of peace... Could never find one myself."
"Learned every weapon, bested every opponent."
"No sword and shield beats old faithful!"
"These old bones haven't failed me yet!"
"Next fool to ask about my face gets a mouthful o' lamp!"
"I'll test their mettle against my fire."
"Always a reason to keep on keepin' on."
"Gotta keep limber at my age."
"Boldness is earned, win after win!"
"Picked up a few tricks during my wandering!"
"Sky looks mighty free of  Void! You're welcome."
"Well, the end o' the world isn't gonna stop itself."
"Warriors, rulers, gods... they all bleed the same!"
"Hmm... Any good fishing spots 'round here?"
"Icathia fell, but the rest of the world won't follow! Not on my watch."
"Living through rough times makes ya appreciate the simple things, like good company... or a hard-boiled egg."
"Bravest hero I ever knew was just a kid. Here's to you, champ."
"If my old Kohari comrades saw me now... hmm... they'd probably say I've lost my touch."
"Shed my old name a long time ago... Didn't deserve it anymore."
"Felt lost before, but you know... I never felt defeated."
"My flame's been burnin' a good while. Still haven't found someone worthy to carry the torch."
"Love sittin' 'round the lamplight and counting my scars after a long day o' beatin' up bad guys."
"Back in my day, we didn't need fancy weapons! Hmph... still don't."
"You stretch first? Be embarrassing if you pulled something."
"We duel to the death! ...Or 'til you surrender, I'm not picky."
"Don't care who you are or where you're from! Question is, can you fight?"
"Really don't wanna fight you! ...HA! Who am I kidding, line up."
"Hold on—let me grab some more 'wisdom' and 'experience'!"
"Make it quick! I'm feeling peckish and got a boiled egg waiting for me."
"Oh, this? Just a fancy-lookin' lamp, don't worry about it."
"Show me something new; I'll even give you the first hit!"
"Yeesh, Aatrox, I thought war gave me issues!"
"You are everything I stand against, Void Empress! You'll go no further."
"Your terror bears no teeth against me, Cho'Gath."
"Fiora! Ready for a rematch?"
"ICATHIA!! There, a battle cry before your beatdown, Garen."
"Heh-hey! Gragas! Whaddya say you and I grab a drink after this?"
"You testing me, Illaoi? I'm in."
"Pride's powerful once it's earned, K'Sante. Let me demonstrate!"
"Aww, if it isn't the whipper-snapper in a Void wrapper. Care to spar?"
"Kassadin. Alone against the Void, it's only a matter o' time before it gets to ya."
"Ughh, Kayle. Being so self-righteous takes all the fun outta fighting!"
"'Prophet of the Void'? Bet you didn't see this comin'!"
"I don't read history, Nasus. I make it."
"Zilean, a man of Icathia. You save the past, I've got the future."
"Facing the Ascended again! This oughta be good."
"Darkin—twisted by Shurima, fallen to the Void, bound to your weapon. I get it."
"I don't hold grudges, Shuriman. But I don't hold back, either."
"Void-born! I'll light the way back to the pit you crawled out of!"
"Who wants a piece of the champ?"
"Fighting words! My favorite kind."
"Imagine if I had a real weapon."
"Not bad! I'll have to remember that one for the road."
"Hit me like you mean it!"
"Don't you let up now!"
"Could do this with my eyes closed."
"At least make me try!"
"This one's got fire!"
"You cruisin' for a bruisin'?"
"Think you can beat me?"
"Show me what you're made of!"
"Yeah, yeah, I see ya."
"Focus! Might learn something."
"Need me to hold back?"
"Got a challenge for ya."
"Quit fighting clean!"
"Don't want what you're heralding, thanks."
"Not taking this place while I'm here, Nashor!"
"Let's see you get outta this!"
"Show me all your might!"
"Here's to you, kid."
"What you lacked in fortitude, you made up in... uh, dirt."
"Shame. You coulda turned the tides with a bit more practice."
"Good try! You almost left a scratch."
"Hey! Let this light a fire under you."
"Yes, you did just lose to a guy with a lamppost."
"Still packs a wallop after all this time!"
"I never get tired of a worthy fight!"
"That was over easy."
"Keep your empire to yourself, 'feathers'!"
"'Void Empress'? More like 'Void... unimpressed.'"
"Shut your gullet, Cho'Gath!"
"Loosen up, Fiora! Tension ruins your technique."
"Well, Kai'Sa, what did you learn?"
"Pipe down, prophet!"
"Now you're history, Nasus!"
"The croc that croaked. Seen everything now..."
"Just getting started!"
"Solid warmup! Who's next?"
"Against any weapon, any army, anyone, I remain unmatched!"
"Turret had it comin'."
"Tower looked at me funny."
"They really just let me do that, huh?"
"All brick, no bite!"
"I'm a Jax of all trades!"
"Got any senior discounts?"
"Shopkeep hitting me harder than my enemies..."
"Ugh. Inflation's really gettin' outta control..."
"Ha! Still trying to sell me an actual weapon!"
"Anglin' takes patience."
"Eatin' good tonight!"
"Givin' the enemy a breather!"
"Oh, wait a second—forgot my fishing pole!"
"Key to being the best is knowing when to rest."
"Time-out! Gotta sharpen my... lamp."
"Gotta go, the eternal light needs more fuel!"
"Didn't see that comin', even though I've got... how many eyes?"
"Ouch! ...Don't much care for the humblin'."
"Ooh, I'll be feelin' that in the morning..."
"Not as spry as I used to be, I guess."
"Can't tell if they just got lucky or if that took real skill."
"Those knuckleheads are getting too rowdy!"
"Alright, now I put my serious helmet on!"
"Surprise! I'm back! ...Aw, no one?"
"Here's to you, kid."
"Who wants a piece of the champ?"
"Imagine if I had a real weapon!"
