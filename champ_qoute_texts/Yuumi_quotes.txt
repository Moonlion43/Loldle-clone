"You and me, we got this!"
"More of a dog person, huh?"
"Cats make great companions! Just ask my master... who disappeared under mysterious circumstances."
"Alright! Which one of you's got great aim, and is good at chin scritches?"
"Who's ready to risk our lives, defeat our foes, and maybe knock over some cups?"
"Tell me the game plan again. Wait. Fish! Someone has fish! Where is it?"
"So, who wants to be my best friend? ...Book, I know you're already my best friend!"
"♪ Where's my fishy fish fish dish? ♪ Meow!~"
"Today we are destroyers!" Yuumi giggles.
"Don't tell anyone but... I love hugs."
"Where's my fishy fishy fish for my dishy dishy dish?!"
"Keep an eye out for red dot, Book! It's gotta be here somewhere."
"The expert huntress stalks the battlefield."
"Where to, Book? Purr~"
"I won't lose you, Book! Not after losing master."
"Book, float us that-a-way!"
"A river? Uh-uh! Book hates water!"
"Do not drop me! Do not drop me!"
"If we find a rat, I call dibs! Or a bug. Or a FISH!"
"This way! No THIS way! Woah-kay, that way it is."
"I could tell you wanted a brave and powerful warrior by your side."
"Okay, it's time to prowl! You do know how to prowl, right?"
"Mush, mush! Wheeeeheehee!"
"They aren't ready for the ferocious team of... US!"
"You can pet me on my chin and back! Nowhere else. Mrow!"
"Ooh, you smell good! Did you recently fish?"
"Rubbing my head on you means you're mine! Purr~"
"Do you ever get so sleepy you fall asleep sitting up? Just me?"
"Wherever you go, I go! Just... don't go somewhere bad."
"Do you have snacks in your pocket? How 'bout now? ...How 'bout now?!"
"I'm like your ghost! oooOOooOOoo!"
"Book, sometimes I pretend you're just a nice comfy box! ...What? That's a compliment! Purr~"
"I've read all of Book. Well, most of Book. I like the pictures of fish... of which there are none, Book! Meow..."
"Hmm, today should I follow my head? Or my nose, or.. Oh! Sunbeam ahead! Let's chase that!"
"If I didn't have to protect Book, I'd just be a normal magical cat floating around  Bandle City! Okay, napping around Bandle City."
"Naps make my magic stronger! It's true! Look!" Yuumi snores and then whispers. "...I'm so strong, mmh, so strong!"
"The Book-keeper is a great role for someone as responsible as me! ...What?"
"I'm descended from lions! And you're descended from trees! We're in our element, Book!"
"If I ever lost you, Book, the fabric of the spirit realm would get all torn up! And I'd lose my best friend."
"Someone scratched out the page that led here! That's right, Book. Someone! We'll never know who."
"Hey Book, do you ever take a nap? ...You can't?! What do you do all day?!"
"Ah, I miss the way my yordle scratched between my ears. ...Being read from cover to cover sounds nice too."
"I save my friends? No one notices. I open a teensy portal to the spirit realm? Everyone is up in my fur!"
"I am the brains, you are the brawn, Book! ...Is Book."
"Hey, new friend? Uh, warn me if you're going to do something crazy, okay?"
"Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey! ...Huh? Oh no, I don't need anything!"
"If someone told you to jump in a lake, would you do it? Just 'cause... I go where you go."
"I bet we'll be friends forever! Well, unless you wander into the brush with your face."
"Don't get too attached, Book! This one looks reckless..."
"In case you're wondering what that smell is, it's Book. Smells like old trees."
"Do you know what "vexatious" means? Book called me that and I think it might be mean."
"The only thing standing between us and lunch is... our enemies."
"Get ready to face the mighty Yuumi! Oh, and Book."
"Rawr!!!" Yuumi coughs. "...'Scuse me."
"Wow, so you're in charge of the giant litter box, huh, bird guy?"
"Hey, Kog'Maw! I like coughing things up too!" Yuumi splutters.
"You can't have Book, large metal cat!"
"Book, you've got it backward. You said Nasus was a god! But he's just a dog."
"Oh wow, hook man! Someone who can actually fish!"
"Oh, so you're Xayah's pet!"
"Tell me, Rengar. How do you groom all that fur?"
"Teemo?" I bet I can eat that guy! Bet I can eat him."
"Rats? I'm against them. Extremely bad."
"Make your shinylight glow, Vel'Koz! I wanna chase it!"
"The red... dot... belongs to you?!"
"Rawr! That's how bears talk."
"My purr is louder than your growl, dog."
"Yeah, you birds can fly! Well, so can cats! This cat."
"I'm gonna eat all your leaves and throw 'em up!"
"Here, fishy fishy fishy! Meow~"
"Have you seen my master? She's about your size."
"Fishy fishy fish! Mmph— Waagh!"
"Well, this is embarrassing...!"
"The ol' pounce 'n' scratch!"
"You're in bite range!"
"Book doesn't like you."
"I hiss at you, giant pile of stones! Hiss!"
"Grr, stupid overgrown scratching post!"
"Oh, I am so knocking that over!"
"Now kill 'em! Kill 'em!"
"Do the bite-y thing! Yeah, that one!"
"We got this? We got this."
"Use your claws! Your claws!"
"Yeah! What they said!"
"Do the secret five claw technique!"
"Ooh! Ooh! Get him! Wooh!"
"Quick, lay on your back and kick 'em!"
"I have the best aim in the spirit realm!"
"I'm Yuumi, and you're warm!"
"I've got a good feeling about this one, Book!"
"So, you need a new shield buddy?"
"Book, meet new friend!"
"I love keeping my friends alive."
"I'll protect you with my wild and furious... meow!~"
"Ooh, you're warm! ...Anyone smell burning fur?"
"I hear you're red dot's master!"
"Ooh, can I climb up on your spike thingies?"
"After this, can you play the piano while I nap, Jhin?"
"Did somebody say fish bone?"
"Don't worry! Specters have nothing on magic cats."
"Grr! I'm a mountain lion!"
"Ah, I see you have the... loud thing, to scare off the enemy!"
"Ugh! You smell like dog!"
"Just two cats, out on the town."
"Has there ever been a 'cat Aspect', Pantheon?"
"Book, meet giant scroll!"
"Spirit realm, here we come!"
"So does your gauntlet help you pet more cats?"
"You smell kinda like my yordle!"
"Time to find a new friend!"
"Back on my own! Meow~"
"I'm an independent cat."
"It's just you and me, Book!"
"We got the zoomies!"
"Now you're ready to prowl!"
"I am the most magic!!"
"I am totally doing this!"
"Go, go go go go go go!!"
"This is my favorite chapter!!"
"Squashed like a bug!"
"Oh! I thought we were playing! Are you dead?!"
"I did it! I knocked it over!"
"We did it! We knocked 'em over!"
"We're killing buddies!"
"Do you want me to bury that?"
"Woohoo! Now I can bat around the body!"
"The power of friendship!"
"Goodbye to the darkness!"
"Heehee! They're never gonna see us coming!"
"Wow, even brighter than my shinylight!"
"Ever pretend you're part of the floor? I do."
"I tried your thing, Book. Now let's try my thing: napping!"
"I guess we're going this-a-way."
"I'll stick with you!"
"Woo! Here we goooooooo!"
"I love this paaaaaaaart!"
"Hang on, Book. ...I am hanging oooooon!"
"No, no, no! We can fix this!"
"Book, what's happening to you?"
"Book, keep your light on!"
"On to the next friend..."
"Ouch! See you in your next life!"
