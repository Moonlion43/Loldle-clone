"Stick with me! I'll keep you warm." Fuemigo cheers.
"What's wrong? Can't take the heat?"
"You guys all look so strong. You can count on me though, I got this!"
"This is so cool. My next letter home is gonna be legendary! Tomasín will be so jealous."
"Come on, fuemigos! We got a lot of work to do. Let's start...oh! Over here!"
"My fuemigos aren't just cute, they're also helpful. Just wait, I'll show you guys."
"Qiyana! Once I'm in the Yun Tal, can we hang out like this all the time?"
"Hey, fuemigo, you okay back there?"
"Even when I'm alone, I'm not lonely."
"My omele... I hope she's proud of me."
"This is the farthest I've ever been from home."
"You can do it, Milio! Thanks, fuemigos!"
"I bet Papa is in the garden right about now."
"Fire burns, but it doesn't have to hurt."
"The world is so... big."
"My family is my guiding light."
"I'm not homesick, I just really... really miss my bed!"
"I wonder who else I'll meet today."
"Good thing I like walking."
"Did you say something, fuemigo?"
"My fire might look scary, but don't worry. It's totally safe."
"I traveled through another village kinda like this."
"There's fire in every living thing."
"A stain! Mama worked so hard on this poncho!"
"Gotta keep moving forward!"
"I carry my family with me."
"I miss Mama's cooking."
"I'm gonna show the Vidalion what I'm made off!"
"My furnacita is the one light that will never go out."
"Did you see that, fuemigos?"
"The jungle isn't as creepy as it looks."
"If I were back home I might be helping Mama cook, or be feeding the animals with Papa."
"When I'm in the Yun Tal, I'm gonna go back home and help my entire village."
"My furnacita isn't as heavy as it looks. I built it myself!"
"Elemental magic is easy. You just gotta think about it, and then – bam, fire!"
"And then cousin Javi was like: 'You're just a baby'. I'm twelve, do I look like a baby to you?"
"My omele always says: 'The sheep that sleeps gets carried by the current'. Wait... That doesn't sound right."
"Leaving home, joining the Yun Tal. It's all for my family."
"My omele says joining the Yun Tal will make my family happy. And she knows best. Right?"
"I'm gonna be the youngest kid to ever join the Yun Tal! Pretty amazing."
"The light inside us, the inner flame – that's the heart of my fire."
"My family is gonna be so surprised by all the things I've done! I can't wait to tell them."
"I've seen so many new things. Met so many new people. Like that plant lady. And that one rock. And that big cat."
"Feels like the whole world is watching me. I gotta show them what I can do."
"This is so exciting! I just know we're gonna be best friends after this!"
"This will be really good practice for when I face the Vidalion."
"Whoa, I bet you're pretty strong, huh?"
"Hey! I'm Milio, and these are my fuemigos. Nice to meet you!"
"Hi! How do I spell your name? For when I write home later."
"Are you okay, little mummy? Do you need a hug?"
"Aww, what a cute stuffed bear. What's his name?"
"Oh my gosh, who are these little buddies? Meeps? So cute!"
"Brand, does your fire heal too? Or is it just for style?"
"Gwen, slow down! My omele always says to not run with scissors."
"Whoa, am I gonna be as big as you one day, K'Sante? I can't wait!"
"So many dogs. Which ones like snuggles most, Naafiri?"
"Neeko! Co'om se henna! Oh, did I say that right?"
"Nidalee! Can I play with the Pakiti again soon? Pleeeeease!"
"You have a big friend too, Nunu? Wonder if I could teach mine to walk."
"Oh my gosh, Qiyana! You're so short in person!"
"Hey, big dagger cat! My hunting's gotten a lot better. Wanna see?"
"Book kitty! So... cute! Must... pet!
"I'm pretty strong. I've been training like... all day!"
"Wait, let me write that down real quick."
"Wanna see a neat trick? Woo! Haha, hahaha!"
"Arrrrrrra! Ya-hooooo!"
"Let's go, fuemigos!"
"Your turn, fuemigos!"
"Woah! Is that a dragon?!"
"Stop, drop and roll!"
"I meant to do that!"
"Everyone, come here!"
"Is this what the Vidalion's gonna be like? Huh, should be pretty easy."
"What would my omele think?"
"Fire is supposed to be the breath of life, not the end of it."
"A-are you okay? Do you need help? I can help!"
"Whoa, you're so strong, Milio! Yeah, I work out."
"I'm just warming up! Get it? ..N-no?"
"Aww, come back! We were having so much fun!"
"My omele was right about the scissors."
"Naafiri, who's a good puppy? You're a good puppy."
"We'll always be friends. Right, Neeko?"
"You don't have to go easy on me, Nidalee. I can take it."
"Sorry, Qiyana. Please, please, don't hate me!"
"Told you I was getting better, big dagger cat."
"Let's head back, fuemigos. It's break time!"
"I'm so glad you're here with me, fuemigos. Let's head back to our secret base!"
"I'll be right back, friends. Stay out of trouble, okay?"
"Come on, Milio, let's take a break! Sigh... Fine, only because you're so cute."
"Mama and Papa will never believe what happened to me today!"
"I just wanna go home..."
"But I wanna help my family..."
"I'm so sorry, omele..."
"Ai! I burn my hair again! Mama's gonna be so mad."
"Even when I'm knocked down, my fuemigos always have my back."
"You okay, Milio? Yeah, all good. Let's go again!"
"Whoa, you guys see that? That was amazing!"
"Gotta burn brighter."
