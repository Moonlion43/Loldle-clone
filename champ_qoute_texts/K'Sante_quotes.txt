"Better to fight, than to live in fear."
"Some of us won't see the end. Remember the fallen, as you draw the enemy's blood."
"Hehe, we don't have to be friends. But we do have to fight, together."
"As much as I wish, a single head can't hold counsel. So please, march with me."
"K'Sante. Hear my name, and know my strength."
"Keep your heads high—we are worthy!"
"Shift like the sand. Strike like the eagle."
"Roar with every step."
"If the enemy asks—I am the answer."
"Those who don't respect me will learn today."
"'Surrender' is a weakling's word."
"Predators become prey, as quickly as night becomes day."
"Ascended, warlords, monsters, they are not so different."
"Good is not enough."
"No monster greater than pride."
"Here, I make my truth."
"I will push them back. Alone, if I must."
"Every scar, a lesson."
"Sometimes a warden must become a warrior."
"Survival is just the beginning!
"The desert was my mentor."
"Hehe, it wouldn't be worth it if it were easy!"
"Open battle honors the hunt."
"Act like failure is impossible."
"Anyone can wield a weapon! Warriors make their own."
"Haha, see the way they scramble like baby armadillos!"
"Heroes are born from crisis."
"My ancestors built Nazumah. No god, king, or beast could conquer them; and none will conquer me."
"I'm grateful for the love we shared, but I'm thankful to walk my own path."
"We were friends, then lovers, then a path... Some hunts fail; some love stories, too."
"In life and in battle, I remember my mistakes. They are my history; my motivation."
"Even now, my people stand with me. My weapons aimed in their name."
"What are you hiding from, Akshan? Fate, or fear?"
"Azir! You think you were born to rule me, but I was born to live free!"
"When auntie said 'strong women are like steel', she was right!"
"You think empire means strength, Darius? Grow up, boy."
"Garen. All privilege, no eyes."
"Hey there, little furry cave thing. Are you lost?"
"No, no-no-no-no! Keep those scissors away from my clothes."
"Don't hold back, Jax. Let me learn, from the best."
"'A brighter tomorrow', Jayce? For all, or for those like you?"
"Nasus! You watched your kind kill my people. Never again!"
"Nilah, you slay monsters—impress me, and we team up."
"A grumpy old goat? People will follow any 'gods' these days."
"The man who made gods bleed. Show me, Atreus."
"You are baccai, are you not...? 'Ok'? Is that it?!"
"Renekton, your carnage ends now!"
"You'll make no trophy out of me, Kiilash."
"I see you don't lack confidence, Sett. A shirt, maybe?"
"Sivir, don't let your bloodline determine who you are!"
"Hello, colonizer! How do you wish to die today?"
"You weave the land's gift, Taliyah. Cherish it."
"The lives lost, the baccai—all victims of your pride, Xerath."
"Others may call you a god. To me, you're just another beast!"
"The worst monsters were once human."
"Great beast, you kill to survive; so must I."
"The Void, is it? All monsters can be slain."
"Not a chance I lose to the likes of you."
"Big egos fall the hardest."
"Hesitation is defeat."
"Until my last breath."
"Underestimate nothing."
"Show me who you are."
"What do you fight for?"
"Whatever you herald, I will end it before it begins."
"Dragons, even here? The hunt never dulls."
"Baron Nashor; the honor is mine."
"Must I do everything?!"
"I'm done holding back!"
"It seems I am built different."
"When one hunt ends, another begins."
"We're finished here."
"There's your comeuppance."
"No 'chicken' should play emperor."
"Jax! Don't use age as an excuse."
"All those books, Nasus... For what?!"
"And now, Atreus, return to your hearth."
"God-warrior Renekton, butchered by a man."
"Gold can't buy everything, Sivir."
"Nothing justifies massacre, Xerath. Nothing!"
"I went all out. You did not."
"Form is temporary, Nazumah is forever!"
"Nazumah..." K'Sante breathes heavily. "Must stand..."
"Pride...! My downfall..."
"Those who wish me dead... Keep wishing!"
"I am not dead. Not yet."
"Like my ntofos—break me, and I return stronger!"
"Why didn't they– No matter; so long as I am here, we can win!"
"Remember the cobra-lion. I didn't give up then. I won't now."
