"Will you prove worthy?"
"The weak fear the shadows."
"Fear controls them."
"The child is gone. The killer will remain..."
"I will survive eternity. They will die today."
"The blood of the fallen will annoint me the new master."
"Everyone does look better in red."
"Lives will be taken, and the real plan revealed."
"Killing is the plan. Let me show you..."
"The true assassin kills one to save many."
"Such noble lies. Save no one, it's so liberating!"
"There is fear in your grip and doubt in your heart."
"I have no heartâ€”that you should fear."
"Rage inside me will not be contained!"
"The spade does not dictate the architect's vision."
"The undoing draws near."
"Cast off the yoke of Zed's order."
"It is the order that will break you, Rhaast."
"Whom should I obey? Master Zed, or the farm implement with delusions of grandeur?"
"Underestimate me at your peril."
"I was born into a nation of despair and I alone am the remedy."
"The shadows reveal weakness."
"I have chosen you. You will serve me."
"The focused blade cuts deepest."
"I have mastered every weapon of war. No prattling tool will prove an exception."
"Neither time nor violence will end me."
"This is the part I like best: the anticipation. No, it's the killing."
"Target the strong. I am a weapon, not some accessory."
"The rage is in your hands. Let it loose!"
"Zed's order shackles you. I offer freedom!"
"Such an obsequious pupil. I will be your new master."
"You are not worthy of the power you hold."
"What will be the final lesson?"
"Give in, and I will show you."
"I am the weapon. You are a tool."
"Lies soothe the mind, don't they?"
"What does Rhaast mean anyway?"
"I learned from a young age to embrace the shadows."
"Darkness is a start."
"I let you go and you will die."
"I see your nightmares. Do they trouble you?"
"Not nightmares. Plans..."
"There is much darkness around you... in you."
"Ionians... Are they all as confident as you?"
"There is no one like me."
"You possess the hubris of a more fearsome weapon."
"Tell me, was it desperation that led you to me?"
"I have waited eons to bathe this realm in blood!"
"Talk, talk... You'll do nothing without me."
"Wait by the river long enough and the enemy dead will float by."
"Oh, yeah... Let's turn this river red."
"Oh, how I miss the smell of blood in the water."
"Today you will be reminded."
"Stain this fetid swamp with their blood."
"Your kind go no further!"
"Your kind go no further!"
"Yordles... Uggghhh, you sicken me."
"This will be quick, but still painful."
"There are a thousand ways to kill you in this moment. I'm planning the right one..."
"I was forged to destroy, and you are in my way."
"I will take that pitiful existence you call a life from you."
"Death and war. This will be delicious..."
"We find Aatrox, and it's a party. Of murder. A murder party!"
"Together, we are unstoppable, Zed!"
"I'm holding a sentient weapon of doom, denied blood for eons! You think I'm scared of you?"
"I can see twelve ways to kill you. Ah! Correction: thirteen. It's thirteen.
"I find your will to live amusing..."
"I smell death... Nope, it's you. You smell... bad."
"A craftsman never blames his tools."
"I will make an exception in this case."
"The blade bends to you!"
"Cowering in the light... how foolish!"
"The shadows find everyone."
"Shadows cut deep as fear!"
"You have my undivided attention!"
"Fear the darkened blade!"
"Never underestimate hatred."
"Every slaughter has humble beginnings."
"Drive me into their flesh!"
"From the shadow comes the slaughter."
"Feed me more lives!"
"He's with you, I assume?"
"Aatrox. We have... history."
"This brings me no pleasure, Shen."
"Teacher and student, yes?"
"This is your master? Zed?"
"The bigger they are..."
"The louder they scream."
"Such a waste of time."
"This will only dull the blade."
"Well... we're here."
"Oh! These legs will take some getting used to."
"Now I own the shadows! I will unleash them upon this wretched place!"
"Oh, the wrath I will unleash!"
"Destruction! Wrath! Fury! As it was meant to be."
"It's all Rhaast now!"
"Poor Kayn. All those plans for naught."
"Goodbye, Kayn! Reaping will commence... now!"
"I am chosen! The Darkin stain lives no more."
"The child is gone. The killer remains."
"In death, Rhaast now serves me."
"I am now one! I am the one!"
"I am the shadow of death."
"I have snuffed out the Darkin, who dares stand against me?"
"The fullness of my truth stands revealed!"
"Oh! I do like this."
"The shadows are my realm... and your grave."
"Fear is your shadow! You are cloaked in it."
"Cowards hide, but never escape."
"With each kill, the shadows grow deeper."
"Those seeking balance will find death."
"That was your destiny... to die."
"Death delivered with precision is true power."
"What was written in shadow, now in flesh."
"Facing me was a mistake."
"Even Zed would be impressed."
"Death finds fools quickly."
"Shadows are a shallow grave."
"My potential has been realized!"
"Those who seek balance find only death."
"The reaping has begun!"
"Tenacity versus fury... Fury always wins."
"These are the strong? Pathetic."
"Worthless foes mock my presence."
"Triumph is built on a foundation of death."
"Every kill fuels my fury."
"Why murder one, when you can slaughter many?"
"This is but a taste of my wrath."
"Just like that, and the world will be yours to destroy."
"Balance is weakness."
"The strong fall so quickly to my blade."
"The only way to kill..."
"You let me in... So foolish!"
"That's one to remember!"
"Disgusting... I love it!"
"Your skills have not improved, Aatrox."
"Sorry, brother. You were in my way."
"Shen. Consider this a debt paid to a friend."
"Demon-pants had it coming."
"You taught me too well, master."
"Live by the shadow, die by the shadow..."
"It should not have come to this, Zed..."
"Zed's final lesson? Don't be him."
"Zed's dead, baby... Zed's dead."
"Noxian strength is a lie."
"No mercy! Right, Noxian?"
"Merely the first to die. There will be more."
"You never forget your first kill... Nope, that's not right. I've already forgotten it."
"Ooohhh! That felt good."
"That's four by my count."
"Stand back! Kayn doesn't know how deadly this thing gets!"
"You wanted mercy? Not from me!"
"Where are the worthy?"
"This will very much upset the balance."
"A match made in shadow."
"Good choice. Pairs nicely with wrath and fury."
"Well, you know what you want..."
"You're making me jealous."
"Not my first choice, but okay."
"Let there be sight."
"For those who cannot see in the dark."
"Done. Now can we continue the bloodbath?"
"Sight... A pitiful crutch for the weak."
"These trinkets only annoy me."
"The fight will continue."
"But there's still so much to kill!"
"The weak run. Stay and fight!"
"Did such foolishness lead to your imprisonment?"
"Do not question me, or my motives!"
