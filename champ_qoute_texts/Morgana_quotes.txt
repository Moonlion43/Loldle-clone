"Wings bound and feet earthly tethered, I move against the false promises of order and justice."
"We may fall today, but still we persist."
"Kayle, blinded by the shadows your light casts."
"I will not disappear, as much as Kayle would like me to."
"I am unmade in the image of my twin."
"Kayle. I know her soul. She broke my heart."
"I shall battle my heartless twin once more."
"You demean yourself to fight amongst the mortals, Kayle."
"My broken heart still beats."

"We are the sum of our mistakes."
"Whether by chains or by wings, we are all bound."
"My flaws are a badge of honor."
"Some call me evil. Shall I prove them right?"
"I will not forsake the land that shaped me. Nor the mistakes."
"Today, it seems we must put our animosity aside."
"We've never been enemies, sister."
"How beautiful your mind must be to think such things."
"How tragic yours to believe them."
"Do not turn your back on me, sister!"
"Your sword is with me. Do you want it back?"
"Still playing with your little human pets, sister?"
"At least I haven't smited all my friends."
"Why have we wings, sister, if not to fly?"

"Let me show you what it is to fall."
"Those who wear armor fear death, Garen. And that's a lot of armor."
"Those you love can destroy you, Jarvan."
"Sister. You broke our family and my heart."
"Kayle, have you forgotten our father?"
"You mask your feelings, Kayle, because you have none."
"Sister. Here to break my heart anew?"
"Better a broken heart than a  shackled soul."
"Are you following me or something?"
"Mother must be so proud of all your murders, Kayle."
"Not murder. Justice."
"What have you done with mother's sword?"
"What had to be done."
"LeBlanc. Wish my twin would disappear as fast as yours."

"You hide behind your laws in arrogance, Kayle."
"My laws have more merit than your whims ever will."
"Do not run from your shadow, Kayle."
"Loves me, loves me not. Loves me, loves me not. Loves me!"
"Loves me, loves me not. Loves me, loves me... not. Ughh."
"Feel something, anything!"
"Why do you think I wear armor, sister?"
"Think you're the only one?"
"I make my own justice!"
"And you damn yourself."
"I make my own justice!"
"Suffer or feel nothing!"
"Share in my torment!"
"Know me by my pain!"
"I will show you pain!"
"Avoid pain, suffer more!"
"Embrace your mistakes!"
"Revel; you are alive!"
"Darkness is a gift!"
"Do not run from your shadow!"

"True justice needs compassion!"
"Justice, how boring!"
"Justice is never blind!"
"Blind faith is for fools!"
"Justice, how boring!"
"Circled by your sins!"
"The earth reflects your torment!"
"Shielded from yourself."
"You thought my magic evil."
"Shielded from yourself."
"Shielded from yourself."
"How 'gracious' of you."

"So this... is how it feels..."
"Ahh... something new...!"
"Back into the fray."
"I have endured worse."
"These mortal cycles begin anew."
"I will bring you all pain!"
"Let's settle this, Kayle!"
"I will never give up..."
