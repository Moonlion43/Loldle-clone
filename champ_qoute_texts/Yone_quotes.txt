"One to cut, one to seal."
"You think I am the one to fear? Hmph."
"Before, I chased a wayward gale. Now I hunt a storm of darkness."
"Many mistake me for the nightmares I slay. Hmph, let them."
"In this cursed second life, where does the mask end, and I begin?"
"They look at me and see only the mask."
"The Azakana have spread like a plague since the Noxian invasion. My work ... never ends."
"Haunted by a past I cannot change."
"A festival of flowers to remember those lost... I think I'd rather be forgotten."
"In life, we died at each other's hands. How can I bear to face my  brother now?"
"Azakana lurk everywhere. I will end their depredations."
"Some days I forget what lies behind this mask."
"Sleep is not for the weak, but for the blessed."
"Demons take many forms, I hunt them all the same."
"The Spirit Realm is... strange. A mirror, an inverse, of our own."
"I do not hunt to kill!"
"No fate, nor destiny. Only tomorrow."
"Now, there is only the hunt."
"Sometimes, to save someone, you must fight them."
"I'm not here to save their souls."
"Honor once bound me above all else."
"Fear, once named, controls no one."
"The road to ruin, I've walked it once before."
"I do what must be done."
"What does one do with an abundance of masks?"
"Forgiveness is... complicated."
"The hunt... it never ends."
"Without a banquet of sorrow, an Azakana starves."
"No sleep, no rest... there is no time."
"Rare is the person who shows their true face."
"The haunted cower behind polite fictions."
"Between uncertainty and fear, the Azakana prowl."
"Forget the past, it only clouds the future."
"Humans lie. Swords... speak truth."
"Wear a mask long enough... and you forget the face beneath."
"On a cliff by the sea, I found the strangest spirit. It walked on four legs and spoke of dreams."
"A broken heart, an anxious mind, all can attract the Azakana."
"Azakana trap their victims in a vicious cycle of emotion. Doubt breeds doubt, fear breeds fear, and the Azakana feasts."
"Long before blades and sorcery are needed, words... can save a soul."
"So many try to flee their burdens. Fleeing is impossible!"
"Every aspect of an Azakana is a stroke. Each stroke forms a character, revealing their true name..."
"One blade carries the weight of my past. The other, holds the key to my future..."
"When we met in the Spirit Realm, this Azakana upon my face knew me!"
"I will take no joy in cutting you down!"
"Blink, and you'll miss your own death!"
"Two paths cross. One, condemned to end."
"Ah, to be blind to the true dangers of this world!"
"A walking feast for Azakana!"
"Such bravado! But you're fooling no one."
"Death rejected me, but I'm sure it will welcome you!"
"Perhaps you can charm some sense into my foolish brother, Ahri."
"Unhaunted, unworthy of my time!"
"Evelynn. A sugary mask for such a master of agony."
"What ancient horror is this? Is... is this what an Azakana could become?!"
"I have fallen outside your cycle, Lamb and Wolf. Are you here to usher me back?"
"Kled... who hurt you?"
"A comfort to see you, Lillia, after so many Azakana..."
"Do not wish to hide behind masks, Lillia. Yours... is a kind face."
"Living nightmare! I will end you before you cross paths with the dream fawn!"
"Guilt clings to you, Riven. Forgive yourself, or the Azakana will find you."
"Balance is a delusion, Shen. Surely you see that now."
"Grafted to a demon by choice? What a grand fool!"
"Tahm Kench. Two-Coats. I know your true name, demon!"
"Taliyah, the one you call master is a fool!"
"Is that the taste of salt on the wind? Ah... hello, brother."
"A broken mask meets a dishonored blade."
"Brother, our paths cross once again. Will our swords do the same?"
"An innocent spirit! I'd... almost forgotten those existed!"
"Azakana, once named... can be bound."
"Ah, eating. How I miss it."
"Kindness is a luxury!"
"This is your remedy!"
"I will save you from yourself!"
"Weighed down by fear!"
"Bound by your insecurities!"
"They always resist redemption!"
"It's too late for you!"
"Your doubt betrays you!"
"You can't flee your fears!"
"Such a burdened soul!"
"Unworthy of my blades!"
"Regrets hold you back!"
"I'm not here for you!"
"Inner demons, hmph."
"No time for sympathy!"
"Aren't you a haunted one?"
"Relinquish your burdens!"
"Yield, or fall to my blades!"
"Your fight is with yourself!"
"I am not the enemy."
"Everyone wears masks!"
"My blades know your name!"
"If only you'd listened!"
"May your spirit find the peace you did not."
"Another Azakana, sealed."
"Their fates, sealed by my hand!"
"A respite, to return the sealed to their rightful place."
"The more I seal away... the more they seem to multiply!"
"With each mask I claim, I come one step closer to understanding my own."
"Another... failure..."
"No respite! No... release..."
"A familiar... embrace..."
"Now... it's a little personal."
"When will I know peace?"
"I thought death would grant me peace. Hmph... how na√Øve."
"Not enough to stop me."
"Every time it's no less strange... nor less painful."
"Mmh... back to the hunt."
