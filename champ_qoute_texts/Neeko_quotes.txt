"Neeko is best decision!"
"They cannot handle Neeko."
"This place tastes like many emotions. Excitement, anger, joy and... salty? Is salty a feeling?"
"Co-'om se-henna. Oh, it means like, um... 'we smile forever.' Friends! That is the word! Friends!"
"I want to become everybody! Who says I cannot? I will prove them wrong! Then, I will become them. Last laugh? Neeko!"
"Sharing memories, colors, feelings is magic! Magic connects people."
"Neeko keeps a tiny bit of everybody's sho'ma. They are precious!"
"After fight ends, everyone invited to picnic! Even enemies."
"Survival means blending in."
"Slow down? No! Fast fast fast!"
"What to do now? Find cheesebreads? Ooh! Have picnic!"
"How can anybody miss home? Home is all around."
"Neeko might have a thing for birds. And bird people."
"The spirits are all around me. Warm, like hugs!"
"Do not be bound to a single body. There are so many more."
"People with no tails! Are they lonely? Yes."
"This is very exciting! Everything is falling down!"
"Neeko does not want to be here when... the others arrive."
"The Oovi-Kats are gone. Neeko is her own tribe now."
"If Neeko becomes Neeko, what does she look like?"
"Neeko is on her fourth tail!"
"No, tail! We must be angry now.
"I will learn! I will grow! I will... Neeko!"
"If Neeko knows your sho'ma, Neeko knows you."
"Beauty shines from inside, where the heart dances."
"Dee dee dee... Just minding my own business, not being Neeko."
"I am being me and doing... me things. Not suspicious."
"I am normal! Everything's normal. Nothing is suspicious."
"It's fun to walk around in different skins. Ahaha!"
"If Neeko can be everyone, how can Neeko be sure she's anyone?"
"No one suspects Neeko to not be Neeko and to be not Neeko instead."
"Neeko must stay unseen... until the last moment."
"Where is Neeko? I saw Neeko by the river. Everyone knows Neeko likes rivers!"
"Is Neeko far? Is Neeko near? No one knows..."
"Be cool. No one suspects you are Neeko."
"No more room for problems please. Only room for more cheesebreads."
"Every place is beautiful. Every place is danger. Is danger... beautiful?"
"The air is part of me. So are the flowers and the rocks. Neeko is everywhere."
"Changing bodies is like changing minds. Easy. Neeko can do it! Everyone else make it difficult."
"Words are tricky. Better to speak with colors and emotion!"
"Sho'ma is like, um... the shape of someone's spirit, who they really are inside."
"Why do people say "Blah blah blah first, ask questions later?" Neeko needs answers now!"
"People say 'The world is Neeko's oyster'. Is oyster a good thing? Taste like grapes?"
"Neeko strong! Can take on world!"
"Who stands in Neeko's way? Dummies with small sho'ma, that's who!"
"Woo! Powerful! Like jungle cat  Nidalee! Ah... I miss her."
"Neeko is not a sad tomato. She is a strong tomato!"
"What does Neeko do with power? Make people behave."
"Stand back! Big strong Neeko coming though!"
"Everyone fears Neeko now! Hahaha!"
"You are not secretly Neeko, are you?"
"Ice bird woman! Woo! Neeko need coat."
"Hello, nature! Nature here looks funny."
"Wow! We do not have that where I come from."
"Nidalee! Weird seeing you here. Neeko misses you."
"No, Rengar! Be nice and sweet like Nidalee!"
"Show me more of the world, Taliyah. Take me with you!"
"May I touch your eyeball? Neeko is gentle."
"Zyra has many thorns. Too hard for Neeko to get past."
"Fa hasici! It means I like you. In a good way."
"After fight, can Neeko tell you about Oovi-Kat tribe?"
"Hello, Vastaya! Do you know  Nami? Is she... nice?"
"You are Vastaya! Neeko is Oovi-Kat. We are... cousins? Distant cousins!"
"Neeko teach you a lesson."
"Bright means danger!
"Battle time! Whoop whoop!"
"Like a wildcat! Rawr!!"
"Neeko cast magic on you. Shoom! Shoom!"
"We are to fight now? Let's go!"
"YOU are in TROUBLE!"
"No more mister nice Neeko."
"I will blast their sho'ma in the face!"
"Your ancestors will feel this."
"You messed with the wrong Neeko!"
"Who strong Neeko now?"
"Too late to play nice."
"No one underestimate Neeko!"
"Neeko will not break your sho'ma. I promise."
"Nice to be something different for a change!"
"Now we are bonded. Thank you!"
"So beautiful! Like moonlight on fresh snow."
"Look out! Neeko so fabulous now!"
"Beep. Boop. Neeko is metal person. Kwatz."
"Ahhh!! Neeko on fire! Just kidding."
"Not monster. Outsider looking in, wanting to belong. Like Neeko."
"Evelynn is so... extreme! Neeko curious..."
"Pretty! For a boy. Too pretty."
"Life as Garen just simple. Just swing sword around. Very bland, yes."
"Yuck! Take a bath. Gross."
"Neeko loves everything about strong... I-yao-i? Did I say it right?"
"The Vastayashai'rei tended your sapling, Green Father."
"Jinx is wild! Break everything! Phew! Phew!"
"I like angry Yordle! STAB STAB! TACOS! SKAAAARL!"
"Neeko always wanted to be a mountain!"
"So many colors at once. Neeko could teach you new colors, maybe?"
"Does dragon lady want to eat lunch with Neeko sometime? Maybe?"
"Hmm... Neeko not the only one who changes."
"The light in me knows the light in Taric."
"How do three people wear one pants?"
"I like this very much! Knife-bird woman! KA-KOOO!"
"Ouch! Zyra always too prickly."
"Neeko will try you on for size. Oooh! I love it!"
"Ohh... Wish I could stay like this forever."
"Neeko is joyful to become you!"
"Looking like boys is, um... takes getting used to."
"Male sho'ma feels... strange."
"Feels same... almost like Neeko but faded."
"Neeko feels wrong. Not good. Void is full of never."
"Just yordling around. Is that what yordles say?"
"Same luck next try."
"Tricky tricky! You got the wrong Neeko!"
"Goodbye, fake Neeko!"
"Nice try, but no Neeko."
"Not Neeko! Hahahahaha!"
"Hahaa! You fell for it!"
"That worked! I fooled them all!"
"Can our spirits be friends still...?"
"Told you to not get close. Why did you not listen?"
"Neeko will keep your sho'ma alive."
"Neeko was out, but never down."
"Poof! Neeko back in her Neeko skin."
"Oovi-Kat vacation over. Back to work!"
"Ugh. Neeko's sho'ma went everywhere. Huge mess. Had to find it all."
