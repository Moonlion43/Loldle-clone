"Fear the assassin with no master."
"You're scared, good to know."
"Take one life at a time. Fast. Clean."
"Time to do what's gotta be done."
"The rules hold you back! Leave 'em for someone who needs 'em."
"Let's make this quick."
"We're gonna do this my way: quick, and deadly."
"Finally. Let's do this."
"I make problems... disappear."
"I am my own master. Just the way I like it."
"Gonna carve my own path."
"I'm not here to make friends."
"Can't stop what's comin'."
"Everyone dies; I just... speed things up."
"You can never have too many kunai."
"Cold steel and a target are all I need."
"I work alone, it's better for everyone."
"You will not stop me!"
"The words on their tombstones will be my new mantras."
"No one tells me what to do. Not anymore."
"It's not about the killing. It's about who's doing the dying."
"Magic's fine — steel's better."
"Restraint's not... really my thing."
"If they're smart, they're scared."
"Let 'em see me, they can't stop me."
"I love what I do. My enemies won't."
"Wars are messy. My kills are clean."
"The old ways just don't work."
"How about I just end this."
"No more meditation or masters!"
"Skill and steel will get the job done."
"They can't stop me. I mean, they can try."
"Kama, or kunai... Depends how I'm feelin'."
"Forget balance. This is a reckoning."
"It's not the killing I'm about — it's the cause."
"The only rule that matters, is that your enemies don't walk away."
"I got a pack full of trouble, and nothing but time."
"So many enemies, so many knives."
"If you look dangerous, you better be dangerous."
"Everyone's got a weakness. That's my target."
"The Kinkou couldn't control me. I do what they wouldn't."
"There are over three hundred pressure points on the human body. No one can protect 'em all."
"I'll make this look like magic."
"The Fist of Shadow was my mom — I do things differently."
"Look, I don't wanna kill you... but I will."
"Call it a purse. I dare you."
"I was trained to kill since I could walk."
"Your window to run away... is closing."
"You think you're gonna walk away?"
"Still time for you to do the smart thing: go home."
"You may wanna rethink this little encounter."
"You're gonna need those bandages, little guy."
"Now you're really playing with fire, little girl."
"The will comes from within, not from the blade."
"Ugh, Jhin. What a drama queen."
"Jinx... Sketchy tats and certifiable. It's just sad."
"How about I take this life, Karma?"
"Katarina! Today you will bleed for Ionia!"
"Kayn. Why are the hot ones always crazy...?"
"Time to snuff out the light, Lux!"
"Yi, another master no one needs."
"You prune the tree. I'm gonna pull some weeds."
"Big targets are easier to hit."
"Bad time to come back to the frontlines, Swain."
"Steel beats rock, Taliyah."
"Better run, Twitch. Hiding won't cut it."
"I'm here to finish what Shen couldn't."
"I am so sick of shadows."
"Ohoho, Zed... This, I will enjoy."
"Let me show you my secrets, Zed."
"You know, we've never met, but you seem really annoying."
"I can make this fast, or really fast. Choice is yours."
"Oh, look. Someone's got a death wish."
"That is just another reason for you to die."
"You really want those to be your last words?"
"Come on, at least try!"
"This won't take long."
"Let's have some fun."
"Too fast! Too good!"
"I can do this all day."
"Time for you to learn."
"Our wills do not align."
"This, is necessary."
"Secrets kept die with you, Zed!"
"Shadows don't scare me."
"Actions have consequences."
"Now, it's personal."
"You came a long way to die."
"Only good Noxian... is a dead one."
"Your colors won't fly here!"
"Quickness is strength."
"You're dead, I'm alive. See? Balance!"
"You look so peaceful!"
"Deftly I travel; swiftly you die."
"Heard you were tougher."
"Still feeling confident?"
"Like you had a chance."
"That's right — payback hits hard."
"You don't get back what I take."
"I'm already thinking about my next target."
"Well you aren't much of a challenge."
"Mark acquired, and eliminated."
"Youth and skill, every time."
"They had it coming."
"You both die, and both lose."
"What a shame. I liked that little guy!"
"Ugh, that was gross."
"Should've stayed hidden."
"Too fast for shadows."
"Okay, that one was messy."
"Don't waste the anger, channel it."
"I was just warming up."
