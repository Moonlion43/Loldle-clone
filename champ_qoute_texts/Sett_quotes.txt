"'Ey, never pick a fight you can't win."
"Wait, hold up. Are we gettin' paid for this?"
"Five versus five? Heh. What kinda sicko is runnin' this rumble?"
"Okay, everyone here knows how to throw a punch, right? 'Cause I don't have time for lessons."
"Listen up, if any o' you don't die out there, I might have work for ya."
"The boss is here. Hold your applause... seriously, be quiet."
"Hey, is there a doctor on hand? Asking for my opponents."
"Hey, uh, listen... My Momma don't need to know about any o' this. 'Kay?"
"Yeah, this'll be a good warm-up for my fight with a giant Kaiju."
"Hmm, Kaiju versus Avalon. Now there's a fight I can sell."
"I don't really need to fight in a giant metal suit, but, you know... why wouldn't I?"
"A big metal version of me. Who wouldn't pay to see that?"
"I don't like hurtin' people. I like the money I get from hurtin' people."
"The crackin' of bones is the clinkin' of coins."
"Ugh... Hey, anyone know whose teeth are stuck in my knuckles?"
"If I ever find my old man... well, I hope he's been trainin'."
"Technique... is for lightweights."
"You swing on the boss? You better not miss."
"Nothin' people hate more than a guy who makes somethin' of himself."
"Must be a fight brewin', my fur just stood up."
"Nothin' I hate more than people with sleeves."
"My coat costs more than this whole damn place."
"They call me a thug. I call me an entrepreneur."
"If anyone's watching this fight... they owe me money."
"Ah, the line of people trying to take me down just ain't long enough."
"I ain't no 'half-breed'... I'm a full breed, and I'm the only one."
"Too hairy for humans, too smooth for Vastaya. What're you gonna do?"
"I don't bother with jabs; if you're throwing, throw it hard."
"Gah, probably shouldn't've have worn my nice pants to this."
"It's all fun and games 'til someone gets their face caved in."
"All words are fightin' words."
"No tappin' out in my pit."
"Everyone's got a plan, 'til they get slammed into the ground."
"All men wanna be me, too bad they ain't me."
"Everyone loses... well, almost everyone."
"Somewhere out there is a demand that needs supplyin'."
"Who's lookin' to lose a fight today?"
"Y'know... you don't really know someone until you fought 'em to the death."
"Ionia... place was so damn quiet before I came along."
"Violence is my business, and business is booming."
"People say they don't like violence... but they all watch."
"Glad I don't have to fight me."
"Bein' the boss is a lot better than not bein' the boss."
"Momma always said I had her temper."
"Only thing an honest livin' makes you is broke."
"Wonder if they make silk pants for these things..."
"I can punch all day in this thing and never break a claw."
"I gotta get one these things for Momma."
"Big time beatdown machine comin' through!"
"A wise master once said, 'Be like water.' Guess I'm kind of a tsunami."
"They say you learn a lot from a beating. If that's true, I've made the whole world smarter."
"I used to risk my neck in the pit making someone else rich. Now, we do it the other way around. I like that better."
"When you're on top, there's always some chump trying to drag you down, pullin' at your feet, scuffin' up your nice shoes."
"They called me 'Sett the Beast-Boy Bastard.' Hah! Now, it's 'Sett the Beast-Man Bastard.'"
"Looks like I brought my fists to a knife fight. Honestly, I feel bad for the knives."
"Look at that face. It's just screamin' 'punch me'!"
"You're the number one contender? Hah, I must've really cleaned out the division."
"Welcome to my show! If you live, I'll have you back."
"If you even dream o' whoopin' me, you better wake up and apologize."
"My old man ran off. You'd be smart to do the same."
"You got guts. Too bad I gotta put my fists through 'em."
"Look sharp, meat! You're in the main event now."
"To be the boss, you gotta beat the boss. I don't see you bein' the boss."
"Hah! I ain't about to lose to that."
"I ain't never lost. You know that, right?"
"Hey, Bilgerat. You see my pop? He'd be a scumbag like you."
"You Noxians ain't all bad. You ain't all good, either."
"You Noxians may have started the fight pits, but I damn sure perfected 'em."
"Hey, you're Noxian, just like my pa. I'll try not to hold it against ya."
"You know the deal, Noxus. Stay outta my business, and I stay outta yours."
"You know, my mom's a Vastaya. That's the only reason I ain't stomped you yet."
"Look at you! Old blood Vastaya! You too good for me? Huh?"
"You're about to see my human sideâ€”the part that ain't so nice."
"Anyone wants a piece of me, line forms right here."
"It's easy to talk big when you still got all your teeth."
"You think I got where I am by listening to people?"
"Love you, Ma. See ya tomorrow. Mwah."
"Only one of us is leavin'."
"Someone hold my coat."
"Oh, look. A punchin' bag."
"Time for a chin check."
"You callin' me out?"
"Gotta put the stamp on 'em."
"You're in my pit now."
"What'd you say 'bout my Momma?"
"Take your best shot."
"This is the part where you bleed."
"Let's give 'em a show."
"Tuck that chin, boss."
"You know who you're messin' with?"
"Better keep those hands up."
"THIS IS GONNA HURT!"
"NOW FOR THE FINISH!"
"Ooh... you should get some ice on that."
"Nope. Not a contender."
"You might wanna stay down."
"Get 'em off my floor."
"Yeah... that's what I do."
"That's a KD... knocked-dead."
"That's a concussion."
"Someone get the cart!"
"Look out, there's a new boss 'round here!"
"Uh, be right back. Gotta check on some, uh... legitimate business."
"Pause the fight! Forgot to stretch. Don't wanna pull nothin'."
"Little break between rounds. Then, come out swingin'."
"Y'know, life's really all about the quiet time between beatdowns."
"Things I love... uh, my Momma, breakin' necks, and fine Ionian silk."
"Hold up! Gotta ice the knuckles."
"I want... a rematch..."
"Wait...? Really...?"
"Tell Ma... they started it..."
"Four hundred eighty-three... and one."
"Tell my pa... I hate him."
"Ain't even thinkin' 'bout throwin' in the towel."
"Alright. I'm warmed up now."
"So, that's losin', huh? Not my favorite thing."
"Aw great, did that leave a mark?"
"It ain't how many times you get knocked down. It's how many times you get back up."
"Well... when life gives you lemons, punch life in the throat."
