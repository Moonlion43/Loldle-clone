"...without the other."
"...without the other."
"Have they forgotten us yet, little Lamb?"
"All still know us, though they try to forget. Soon we will remind them."
"Tell me again, little Lamb, which things are mine to take?"
"All things, dear Wolf."
"Are you there, dear Wolf?"
"What does it feel like?"
"A long hunt with no kill."
"Is this what it feels like to end?"
"I do not know, for this is not our end."
"Do others come back?"
"Those who do, wish they hadn't."
"How old are we, Lamb?"
"Older than those whose footsteps are long vanished."
"I remember them all."
"Those who dread us grant us the most power."
"We are not dreams. We are the waking."
"Those who run from death... stood still in life.
"Beauty fades. That is why it is beautiful."
"Tomorrow is a hope, never a promise."
"There are so many ways to die.
"The only true death is to never live.
"Wolf chases what does not willingly go."
"All will know us... in time.
"Follow their tracks."
"I smell their fear."
"Can't wait for them to flee!"
"Fear makes the chase more fun!"
"All who run are mine!"
"Hurry, Lamb. Faster."
"Bits of them stick in my claws!"
"I wonder how they see me."
"All things linger..."
"And everywhere Lamb went..."
"...Wolf was sure to follow!"
"The weft and weave of fate guides—"
"Words spoil the chase!"
"How does hunger feel?"
"Peacefully, they go."
"What sound do they make?"
"Feathers falling on fresh snow."
"Only to find us sooner."
"How long will we be together?"
"They know we'll come."
"Yet they are never prepared."
"And everywhere Lamb went..."
"...Wolf was sure to follow."
"We understand your loneliness, but..."
"We know your name, child. Woven across countless almost-lives."
"Rushing to meet us again, I see."
"Have we met before?"
"His song sounds good."
"The singer mistakes melody for substance."
"Long have we shadowed your deeds."
"Turn and face us now!"
"Trees make a boring chase!"
"Rengar is well-versed in the ways of the hunter."
"Come, Sion, let us end this mockery."
"Sometimes, death is a blessing."
"There are no wolves like me!"
"Chasing is the best game in the world... and I always win!"
"Choose now: my arrows..."
"They are called... tears."
"It thinks it can beat us!"
"This is called... denial."
"I'll give you a running start!"
"Not that it will help."
"The weft and weave of fate guides... um... uh... how did that poem go again?"
"Ahh! Don't shoot me!"
"I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm bored, chase chase chase!"
"What happens if you miss?"
"Words, words, la la la, pew twang pew!"
"Are you imitating me?"
"How one dies shows how one lived."
"Embracing life means accepting death."
"You shine brightly."
"Drift gently into oblivion."
"All sparks kindle new flames."
"Panic not when life ebbs."
"This will hurt... lots!"
"They break too easy!"
"Tear out the throat!"
"Ready to chase? Too bad!"
"They struggle! Good!"
"Day always turns to..."
"Flee, or stand firm."
"Your next treat, dear Wolf."
"A fine life reaches its conclusion."
"Their path is destined to cross ours."
"I hope this one has strong legs!"
"I will chase it until it's dead!"
"Shall we, dear Wolf?"
"Its heart beats fast now!"
"This next one will be easy."
"The masks of the Kindred seek you!"
"Treasure your final moments."
"Eternal twilight calls for you."
"Our mark looms over you."
"Fate hunts you today."
"Your time has come."
"We have always known it."
"Such befalls all who bear our mark."
"All life is temporary."
"All your life has led to this moment."
"That was a good chase!"
"Hahahahaha! That was fun!"
"What do all stories have in common, dear Wolf?"
"Our mark is lifted."
"Only to place it elsewhere."
"None are, dear Wolf."
"We shall remember this theft."
"What folly it is to snatch our marks."
"That was meant to be ours."
"How fast can you run?"
"You stole my chase!"
"You steal from us..."
"...we steal from you."
"An emboldened thief."
"Chase to your heart's content."
"Savour life's closing act."
"Shine once more, before the end."
"Well hunted, dear Wolf."
"All things, great and small..."
"If it draws breath..."
"Few are, dear Wolf."
"More lie ahead, dear Wolf."
"Strip away their armor."
"Forged in a land unwelcome to us."
"It courses with stolen lives."
"They shall not ignore us so easily."
"A sharper blade makes for a cleaner death."
"Sharp enough to slice the veil between life and death."
"They shall only hear my voice."
"They will see two of me!"
"The weft and weave of fate guides—"
"The hunt is back on!"
