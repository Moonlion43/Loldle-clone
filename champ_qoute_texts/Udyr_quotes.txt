"Conflict feeds the Freljord."
"The spirits at the heart of the Freljord have need of me. I answer their call."
"Hear me, spirits. I pray for struggle. I pray for growth."
"I can taste our enemies' hunger for victory. Let them starve."
"For many years I thought I was cursed. I still wonder."
"Ordinary lives hold beauty."
"Twice I have loved, twice I have left."
"I do not channel the demigods."
"I did not truly know the Freljord until I left it."
"Weapons are for the weak."
"Great Seal Sister, guide my steps through treacherous waters."
"The  Winter's Claw was never my home."
"A stagnant Freljord is a dead Freljord."
"Bodies are not vessels. They are anchors."
"I channel the spirits I feel closest to."
"The Seal Sister blesses with water and salt."
"I do not fight alone."
"Demigods cannot be trusted with balance."
"Animals act on instinct, not choice."
"My time in  Ionia taught me control."
"This life is my burden, and my land's blessing."

"Mastery is a volcano, and I will rise within it like magma."
"Struggle, challenge, growth... hm, the marrow of life."
"May we never know life without the frost."
"Anger the phoenix, and feel its talons."
"I enter the fray, anger in my heart and ice in my veins."
"The beasts I channel within me are not me, but they are mine."
"Wants and needs are not the same. Wants echo. Needs howl."
"The Winter's Claw remembers the beast I once was... what I nearly did..."
"Kalkia helped me find myself. Lee helped me claim myself. Both good lessons."
"My power deepened after a meal from that old woman. Almost feels like a Seal Sister tale!"
"War with the  Avarosans will end. Then my time, my life, will be my own again."
"Sejuani's  boar, her True Ice, her people, her purpose... I will protect them all."
"Years of training, and the needs of others still ring louder than my own!"
"Why, spirits? Why was I chosen? For this struggle, will there ever be rest?"
"Greetings are a waste of time."
"I choose this fight."
"Our fight will keep the Freljord alive."
"Your hunger for battle is too weak to overcome me."
"I am not good with people."
"We will both grow from this."
"You cannot stay above it all, great Frostbringer. If the Freljord dies, it won't rise again."
"The Freljord would die in your hands, Ashe, broken beyond repair."
"Thousands of spirits, screaming... silenced... warped! What are you?!"
"I have missed you, Lee. Let our spirits meld, let us spar."
"Ice Witch, you are a blight on the Freljord! I will be its cure."
"Weapons are often the tools of cowards, great forger."
"Sejuani, do not make me your enemy. Please!"
"Arrgh! Stay out of my mind, Thousand-Pierced Bear!"
"There are no wolves within you."
"There are no wolves within you."
"No one survives life."
"Strength of spirit!"
"Lock horns with me!"
"Your protective nature shines through you, spirit."
"I will put your gift to good use, protector."
"Abomination! I lay you to rest with no regret."
"This... thing has no spirit. It is empty."
"This cavern is not your home, dragon. Why defend it?"
"The spirits of dragons burn and roar long after they die."
"Alone, proud, feeling... hoppy?"
"This form... her prison."
"Let me help you, Rift Herald."
"Stone-bodied, but with a living heart inside."
"I... We... live and die together as unshakable stone."
"We smell blood on the air. A feast awaits!"
"Hunger, gnawing, wild, wolven!"
"I feel her need to protect the nest."
"Mother raptor, forgive my trespass."
"I am sorry for what I must do, Scuttler."
"Scuttlers are such gentle souls."
"Our spark runs wild!"
"Lightning is not a single bolt, but a storm!"
"Our hide, our armor!"
"No attack can bend our iron resolve!"
"You cannot outrun me!"
"You cannot escape our inferno!"
"The storm rages through me!"
"Frost and fury, our perfect storm!"
"Fallow Fox keep you."
"To take life... I do not do it lightly."
"Your struggles are ended."
"Balance is not always fair. I am... sorry."
"A moment of silence."
"The circle continues, unbroken, unwavering."
"With your death, Ashe, the True Ice will not melt."
"My most worthy and most beloved opponent."
"I close my mind to you, great Valhir!"
"Thank you for refusing to strengthen my enemies!"
"No peace for the Freljord!"
"A great beast has been felled... without proper rites."
"I venerate my kills. My enemies, they revel in theirs."
"Needs in the Freljord are loud. Meditations quiet my mind."
"I see the world through the eyes of those I channel."
"Each stance flows into the next like water."
"The frost... is melting..."
"Silence... at last..."
"Urgh, even in death, silence is brief."
"Instinct led me one way. Training, another."
"Not yet, Fallow Fox."
