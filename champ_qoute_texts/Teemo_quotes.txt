"Bandle scout Teemo reporting for duty!"
"Awh, scout life isn't for everyone I guess..."
"Goggles: check. Hat: check. Mushrooms: check. Okay, armed and ready!"
"Hello scouts, I'll be your troop leader for today. Let's have fun!"
"Alright, let's throw 'em a  Bandle City bash!"
"Hup, two, three, four!"
"Sound-off, one, two; sound-off, three, four!"
"There's always more world to see."
"A Bandle scout is a friend to all!"
"A Bandle scout is always prepared!"
"Scout and observe..."
"Another day out in the field!"
"Hello, trees! Hello, rock! Hello, grass!"
"Nothing like a good walk!"
"All roads lead to  Bandle City."
"If there's trouble, I'm there!"
"Where did I put my goggles... Oh, ha, wait–they're on my head!"
"Strangers are just friends you haven't met yet."
"The world is so big–there's always something to explore!"
"If you're not ready for everything, you're not ready for anything!"
"I pledge to uphold the Bandle scout way and serve yordlekind each and every day."
"Yordles are never alone. Every river is our friend; every pebble, our bestest buddy!"
"'Bandle scout' isn't just a title–it's way of life!"
"Never underestimate the power of the Scout Code!"
"You look like you could use some help!"
"Are you in need of assistance?"
"Oh. Hello, new friend!"
"Bandle scout troop leader Teemo at your service!"
"How's the weather up there, Corki?"
"Aquatic yordle sighting: throws fish?! Details to follow."
"Whoa, what kind of yordle are you?"
"Hey, Kennen, if I train you in the scout code, can you train me at the ways of the Kinkou?"
"Hello, Mr. High Major Commodore of the First Legion Third Multiplication Double Admiral Artillery Vanguard Company Sir!"
"Oh hey, Lulu. Are you and  Pix playing out here? Oh-- can I join in?"
"Whoa, i-is that the Poppy? I've never seen a hero up close before!"
"How's the mech, Rumble? Did you fix the random exploding yet?"
"I promise I haven't gotten into any more trouble, Tristana...! At least, not yet."
"Veigar, stop being evil–it's not nice!"
"Hey Vex, let's turn that frown uuupside down!"
"You look like my pet Fluffy! ...He was a soul-devouring sea worm."
"Another yordle! Hiiii!"
"Scout journal update: my new friends don't understand... 'hello'."
"Didn't see that comin', did ya?"
"I still need my 'Defeat a Void Monster' badge!"
"Gotta stay quiet..."
"Don't be suspicious..."
"They don't see anything...!"
"Right in the blinkers!"
"Got somethin' on your face!"
"Watch your step...!"
"Here's a mushroom with your name on it."
"Gonna leave this riiight here."
"Everything is better with mushrooms!"
"They really should slow down."
"That's why scouts stay vigilant!"
"That's gotta sting."
"Those puffcaps sure are somethin'!"
"Uhh... A-are you okay?"
"You're really sleepy, huh?"
"Awww, all tuckered out...!"
"Phew! I should take a break soon, too! Hehh."
"It's okay, you'll become a scout someday!"
"Let's play again sometime!"
"Oops. Did I do that?"
"Did anyone else hear that? No...? Okay!"
"Gotta come down sometime, Corki."
"Scout journal update: throwing fish, confirmed!"
"Aww, he was just a cranky little guy."
"OW! I-I think I still have static in my fur..."
"I'll give you a twenty-one-dart–salute, Sir!"
"I WIN!! Good game, Lulu, well played."
"Even heroes gotta take a break; huh, Poppy?"
"Whoa, you've got an eject button! Is that a new feature, Rumble?"
"Maybe you'll be less evil after a nap, Veigar."
"You would be a perfect Bandle scout, Vex!"
"See you back in  Bandle City!"
"Always happy to lend a hand!"
"That's my 'Assist a Friend' badge!"
"Another win for teamwork!"
"Like the Bandle scout handbook says: 'Leave the forest cleaner than you found it.'"
"No more shooting, Mr. Turret!"
"Eh, I'll clean that up later."
"Hello, shopkeep. What's the latest?"
"With this purchase, I'll get my 'Responsible Consumer' badge!"
"One more badge for me!"
"A Bandle scout always strives for excellence!"
"Every adventurer should know when to rest."
"Sometimes, it's good to retrace your steps!"
"Back to  Bandle... City..."
"The scout spirit... lives on..."
"No matter how impossible the mission: I won't give up!"
"Just another chance to show the tenacity of the Bandle scout spirit!"
"Scout journal entry: Had a... 'mushroom-related' incident. Returning to the field–now."
"What a story–I gotta write that one down!"
"That was tough–but I'm tough too!"
