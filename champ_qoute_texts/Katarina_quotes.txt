"Violence solves everything."
"Is that fear I smell?"
"I've made my choice."
"Keep friends close and enemies guessing."
"Why? Because I can."
"Only fools hesitate."
"Better dead than dull."
"Come on, live a little... while you can!"
"If you run, you won't see me stab you!"
"Let the bloodshed begin!"
"Is that fear I smell?"
"Only fools hesitate."
"The dance of blades."
