"Shatter their expectations."
"My countermeasures are ready. Even if you are not."
"Perhaps it's time for the era of the  Arcane."
"Medardas are known for our strategy and strength. Follow my direction and we'll emerge from this victorious."
"There's no telling what fate has in store for us… All we can do is move forward."
"It seems as if my absence has left you doubting my abilities. I'll resolve that misconception."
"I am no stranger to war—allow me to finish what our foes have started."
"If blood must be drawn to secure our safety, so be it."
"I never thought I'd see the day. Let us fight together, mother… as equals."
"My mother is willing to sacrifice anything, anyone. If you value your life, do not hold back."
"What else is hidden beneath my sigils…?"
"To blend in, we shed authenticity."
"Only trust those who've earned it."
"Steady is stagnant."
"Kino… I should've been there for you."
"Any desire can be exploited."
"A true leader is secure in her judgment."
"I'm no longer bound by  her standards."
"I deserve everything I've attained; I know that now."
"Compassion does not beget weakness."
"Leadership requires one to learn quickly and constantly."
"War should only be a last resort."
"The wolf, the fox—both necessary, both unrelenting."
"Change is the only constant."
"Any worthwhile venture involves risk."
"Inaction invites regret."
"I choose to forgive wherever possible."
"The best lies are wrapped in truth."
"Assess the surroundings; anticipate any outcome!"
"Now that I've returned to my family, what challenges await us?"
"The arcane is at my fingertips…"
"The  Black Rose will answer for all that they've done."
"See through deception."
"To think these gifts were hidden within me. The lives I could have saved…"
"Everything I accomplished in  Piltover means little in the eyes of  Noxus."
"With each obstacle I overcome, I leave behind a chasm of uncertainty."
"Revenge is shortsighted; I cannot submit to its temptations."
"My family once cast me out—yet, part of me still loves them."
"Raised in Noxus, shaped by Piltover, tainted with magic. Many question my motives, but their whispers do not define me."
"For so long, I wanted to regain my family's respect; but I wasn't prepare for what it would cost me…"
"Lies may seed hope in the naive, but they erode the roots of those who plant them."
"The Medardas depend on my strength. My unwaivering conviction."
"What is it that you hope to accomplish?"
"I suggest you reconsider! There's no reason for you to suffer."
"Willing to risk your life for this endeavor?"
"My presence alone is your final warning."
"It's not too late for you to turn back!"
"Something tells me you're not interested in a peaceful resolution."
"Mother… I'm ready to show you what I've learned."
"Our alliance was fruitful, Kiramman. A pity it had to end."
"A man with an inflated ego. Groundbreaking."
"Professor… is this your last act of defiance?"
"Such… despair. What is it that haunts you, Hwei?"
"What will prevail, our affection, or our ambition?"
"I overlooked your mayhem once, Jinx. I will not repeat that mistake!"
"I see your face, deceiver; and you shall never forget mine!"
"Let's see whose light shines brighter!"
"You move through this world as I once did, Senna… as if you fear losing yourself to your past."
"Tell me, Jericho Swain: is your vision as sharp as your tongue?"
"Vi… When you try to please everyone, no one is satisfied."
"You claim to desire 'peace'; but it seems our definition may differ."
"The foolish need not approach!"
"Empty platitudes provide little comfort."
"You seem ill-prepared."
"Spare the pleasantries."
"Bother someone else."
"A necessary maneuver."
"I cannot be undone!"
"Your promises will not sway me!"
"The perfect creature to test the limits of my magic!"
"Your best was insufficient!"
"Was that your full strength?"
"I hardly felt a thing."
"The wrath of the Medardas!"
"Illuminate their lies!"
"I'll outshine them all."
"An avoidable outcome. Shame."
"Another malefactor subdued."
"Call it 'magical intervention'."
"Nothing I couldn't handle."
"You were in over your head."
"This conflict was beyond your comprehension."
"Well, I would have preferred a compromise…"
"Thought I'd… 'lighten' the mood a little."
"You are no Medarda."
"You taught me well, mother: a wolf has no mercy."
"Draven, such bravado! And such… fragility."
"With my deepest respect and appreciation, professor."
"From one artist to another: your passion outshines the pain."
"Another love, torn away… Goodbye, Jayce."
"Such senseless chaos, Jinx."
"Tell the others I'm coming for them. Sister."
"Even in defeat, your light never dimmed."
"Senna, there is no more past; rest, now."
"General. Didn't foresee this outcome, did you?"
"Was the badge worth it, Vi?"
"And here I thought you were more than another man with a god complex."
"THEY FALL BEFORE ME LIKE LONG SHADOWS CAST BY A SETTING SUN!"
"Fatigue is the enemy of success."
"Such negotiations are rarely linear."
"Just a moment—I require additional resources!"
"Rest is strategic: restoring the body and reigniting the mind."
"Medardas stay ready at all times, be it with friend or foe."
"Does my family… fall with me?"
"I did my best, Kino…"
"Mother, I couldn't…"
"So, I've returned—yet another mystery!"
"Adapt to their behavior. No more mistakes!"
"My magic still flows. Do my sigils protect it?"
"No, I was born to lead; I will show them why."
"Focus. Do not lose your composure."
