"They are nothing before me."
"The enemies of Demacia will fall."
"The quiet before battle."
"They should run now."
"They have faced nothing like me."
"Behold my true form."
"Tremble before the power of a dragon."
"Power flows through me."
"Come get a glimpse into the belly of the beast!"
"Think you're a dragon slayer? Come here and try."
"The might of Demacia will prevail."
"They see their end."
"They are nothing before me."
"By the blood of my father, I will end them."
"I will dance in their ashes."
"I love the quiet before battle."
"Dragons have no remorse."
