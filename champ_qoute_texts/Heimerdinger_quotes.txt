"Indeed, a wise choice."
"I could do that better."
"By my calculations... "
"Back to the drawing board!"
"I put the scheme in schematic!"
"Fascinating, isn't it?"
"Not enough variables... hmm... not nearly enough variables."
"One step closer to greater understanding!"
"Order, entropy; a never ending cycle. Or is it?"
"Hmm... let me fix that."
"Hmm... very interesting!"
"Order, entropy; a never-ending cycle."
"Did I leave the Tridyminiumobulator on?"
"Just as I hypothesized!"
"I do love a good conundrum."
"The cosine of U-root, divided by... "
"What an uncommon denominator!"
"Every problem solved is another revealed."
"Yes, yes, hurry, I have important work to get back to!"
"Wonderfully efficient!"
"Ah, Jayce. Mind if I borrow some of your 'hexpertise'?"
"Groundbreaking hextech innovation employed in the service... of punching."
"I don't agree with your methods, but by golly, do you get results!"
"If you seek to replace all humans, there will be no one left to appreciate your work."
"Would you mind taking your hexplosives elsewhere?"
"Have you considered making quieter hexplosives?"
"Your hexplosives are disturbing my research."
"I prefer a battle of wits, but you're unarmed!"
"Don't worry, you can learn so much from failure."
"Why do chemists call helium, curium, and barium 'the medical elements'? Because, if you can't 'helium' or 'curium', you 'barium'! Hm hm!"
"There are three key ingredients to invention: excessive imagination, good old fashioned stick-to-it-iveness, and a rocking good hairstyle!"
"Why do people say 'you can't trust atoms'? Because they 'make up everything'! Hehe!"
"I theorize... your defeat!"
"Testing in progress!"
"This calls for a prototype!"
"Stop that! You will damage my turrets!"
"I've applied the formula for success!"
"I require my adjustable reverse-ratcheting magnetic box wrench!"
"This behaviour is highly inefficient!"
"They'll have a few screws loose by the end of this!"
"Stand back! I am about to do... science!"
"Working as intended!"
"Back, you dirty ape, back!"
"This will put a wrench in their plans!"
"You are poorly designed for this!"
"Exceeding turret output capacity!"
"Hmm, it's smaller than the diagram."
"Perhaps I should try more rockets!"
"No, not all the rockets!"
"Ah, the sweet smell of science!"
"Aghnn... Dut-dut... What's that, ergh-... Come on. Enngh... ?! WAAAAAaaaâ€”"
