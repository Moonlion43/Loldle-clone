"Death is like the windâ€”always by my side."
"Whispers on the wind speak of a masked swordsman with two blades."
"My brother returned. Seems dying was the easy part."
"This story is not yet finished."
"Justice. That's a pretty word."
"This blade never gets any lighter."
"Is a leaf's only purpose to fall?"
"Just looking for a road home."
"Follow the wind, but watch your back."
"I will follow this path until the end."
"Virtue is no more than a luxury."
"Hmph. One step ahead of the past."
"No one is promised tomorrow."
"Never could stay in one place."
"Honor is in the heart, not the name."
"Sleep is for the guiltless."
"My honor left a long time ago."
"I will not forget who I am."
"A wanderer isn't always lost."
"A sword's poor company for a long road."
"Hmph... dying's the easy part."
"The road to ruin is shorter than you think."
"I thought Azakana were nothing but children's tales. How wrong I was."
"Wuju? Hmph. Never heard of it."
"Nice... sword... boots?"
"Wuju? No, I wouldn't."
"You can't run from yourself, Riven... I've tried."
"Broken sword. Broken spirit."
"Everyone faces a reckoning, Riven."
"Which weighs more, Riven? Your blade, or your past?"
"Huh, three swift strikes..."
"Wait, that technique... huh."
"Another wind blade?"
"Who taught you that?"
"Scurry back to your shadows, ninja."
"Ninjas... I hate those guys."
"Cute mask. Your, uh, mom sew that?"
"An unworthy blade meets a cursed mask."
"Brother, what have you become?"
"Yone, I learned your lessons too late."
"If you've come to kill me... I hope you brought friends."
"There is only death... mine, or yours!"
"Killing people is a bad habit... but I can't seem to quit."
"The blade above all things... except a good drink."
"There are three certainties in life: honor, death, and hangovers."
"I'll give you the easy way out."
"Kill me? You can try."
"Some mistakes you can't make twice."
"I will not die dishonored."
"Don't start what I'll finish."
"At peace with yourself? You will be."
"It is not yet time to die."
"People keep running into my blade."
"I alone decide my fate."
"One blade, one purpose."
"Some things never dull."
"It's just death. Nothing serious."
"It always ends in blood, brother."
