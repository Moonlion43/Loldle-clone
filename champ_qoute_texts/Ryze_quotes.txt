"A step ahead of cataclysm."
"The things I've seen in the dark corners of Runeterra are better left unseen."
"If I sound rude, it's because I've got a world to save."
"I find the runes so they won't be found by someone else... or some
"Things to do today: find food, build shelter, fix the world."
"Can we make this quick? I have some place to be!"
"I sense another rune, but where?"
"You know what I miss? Standing still."
"They know so little of the world they traverse."
"Consider yourself lucky for the days you have."
"Some stones are best left unturned."
"I work alone. Company weighs me down."
"They have forgotten the fires that forged this world."
"All this would be so much easier if I didn't give a damn."
"When I've found them all, I'll fade away."
"These runes are not for eyes such as yours."
"Knowledge is a real weapon."
"They want to read my scroll. It'll be the last thing they read."
"All that binds this world is will."
"Roast duck, warm fire... someday."
"I fight so they don't have to."
"You know what I could use? An ale."
"Just once I'd like a good night's sleep."
"The wise seek to contain power."
"Power changes everyone."
"What's on my back? That's not your concern."
"Everyone is doomed to repeat history. That's where I come in."
"Every rune I find is another day we live."
"Everyone wants to chat when you're busy saving the world."
"The runes decide my path."
"I've heard entire nations go silent."
"Fast and lean, that's how I travel."
"I long for the day when this is all over."
"I dream in nightmares of the past."
"Blessing or curse, what's the difference?"
"I remember when only one world weighed on my shoulders."
"Take care with this world."
"If I had a rune for every mile I've run, I'd be done running."
"I like my tragedy narrowly averted."
"Do not walk through history. Run."
"You want to help? Get out of the way."
"If I fall, the scroll must be destroyed."
"Ah, civilization. I remember when I was a part of it."
"Their minds couldn't handle what my eyes have seen."
"In an instant, all could be gone."
"I care about these mortals. That's why I keep them at arm's length."
"Trust no one, especially those who seek power."
"Ah, Runeterrans. So endearing, so foolish."
"Quickly but carefully."
"Magic dooms us... but perhaps it can save us."
"Terrible things are afoot."
"I may fail, but I won't quit."
"My story? That would take ages to tell."
"One can only hold all this power for so long."
"I could tell you what's on this scroll, but then I'd have to obliterate you."
"None are worthy of my task... even me."
"Your charms are impressive, but I'm not into forest creatures."
"Run along, child, this tome is not a bedtime story."
"Space called, it wants its arrogant jerk back."
"I don't suppose you'd want to get off your magical rear and help me save this world."
"I have a hard time believing you went to medical school."
"I would chide you for your idiocy, but you seem pretty proud of it."
"Nice tattoos, do they conduct runic energy? No? Oh, that's too bad."
"Magic is more than sunshine and rainbows, girl."
"Hey, you're the one who summons bloodthirsty Void creatures, right? Yeah, brilliant work, good thinking."
"Nice card trick, do you do birthday parties?"
"That remarkable arcane energy doesn't run through your entire body, does it?"
"You wage your petty war, Noxian, but the real war is yet to come."
"Even your kind will know death in the cataclysm."
"If I had a tattoo that looked like you, I'd get it removed."
"Hm. I'm hunted by things far worse than you."
"There's gonna be two sounds: me hitting you, and you disintegrating."
"To be ignorant is to be free. You must be very free."
"I'm no doctor, but I think there's a spell for what you have."
"You should read more, expand your vocabulary."
"So that's what you people do with your spare time."
"I'm surprised you can string enough words together for that one. You need a break?"
"Not going to dignify that with a response."
"We'll see how smart your mouth is when the world collapses."
"Okay, fine, here's a magic trick. Tada."
"What? You want to see a magic trick? Fine... tada."
"A fine edge you dance on."
"I read the runes. You lose."
"I don't have time for this!"
"Hands off the runes."
"You've got nothing."
"You won't win this."
"They come for the scroll."
"Let's have it, then."
"You know nothing of loss."
"I am just a vessel."
"Are you following me?"
"Keep your distance."
"Come. The runes beckon."
"A rune mage must keep moving."
"Flee if you want to live."
"Let's go, let's go!"
"Our fight is elsewhere."
"Learn from your mistakes."
"One more needless death."
"Better you than me."
"Another joins the energy pool."
"Better a few perish than the entire world."
"They make the same mistakes again and again."
"That's what happens when you piss off an archmage!"
"Too many have met the same fate."
"I tried to warn them. I really did."
"What is made can be unmade."
"Another barrier down."
"One less thing to kill me."
"Let's move, the path is clear."
"One less impediment."
"Great, more things to carry."
"Provisions purchased."
"That's gonna load me down."
"Many lives it's taken, and many souls."
"Strange how it beckons."
"An object of foul origins."
"Now I'll never tire."
"Fuel for the rune race."
"Such a vile text, but useful."
"A sordid relic from a brutal time."
"Not a book for the faint of heart."
"In case my head gets cold."
"To cover my bald spot."
"A hat with a face, huh? Sure, why not?"
"A potent haberdashery."
"Brings out my colour."
"Even the gods can weep."
"I remember when such tears were shed."
"Such a weapon must be treated with respect."
"I'd destroy it... if I didn't need it."
"I can feel its power surging."
"Their weapons will fail to scratch."
"Protection from primitive arms."
"I defy swords and arrows."
"I thought that guy would never stop talking."
"Sight is better than swords."
"Dark corners made bright."
"They come for what I know."
"Watching the watchers."
"Dark shadows hide dark forces."
"I'd like to see them try."
"For whatever lurks behind me."
"I never liked surprises."
"If I can see it, I can beat it."
"Always learning, always seeking."
"Those who seek improvement, improve."
"This power continues to build."
"Time to reflect on what we have learned."
"I'll return stronger. Count on it."
"Hang on, archmage business."
"A moment to gather our runes."
"I'm not running away. I'm running at you the long way around."
"A pause in the chaos. Let's make it count."
"They will not... take them... "
"The scroll... burn it... "
"Thank the gods, the world's still here."
"Ugh, being dead wastes precious time!"
"I still live, but for how much longer?"
"Let's try again, and this time do it right."
"A stupid mistake, one I won't make again."
"I will show you arcane magic."
