"Are you the hunter... or the prey?"
"You wouldn't last a day in the Void."
"My appearance may frighten you, but make no mistake: I am on your side, and we fight to the bitter end."
"This suit lives on me. It calls me home. We survive together..."
"Stay with me, and we live."
"When memories fade and darkness surrounds you... find the strength inside."
"You know that feeling, when your skin crawls? Like a thousand needles poking through every pore? Blood pounding through every vein? ...That's just an itch, compared to what lives on me."
"Here is where we make our stand. Do as I say. It's the only way, if we want to live."
"The first time I returned from the  Void... It was to save me... Now, it's to save them."
"Come with me if you wanna live."
"Reunions can be so bittersweet."
"Could it-... be true?"
"It smells like home here..."
"Huh... Memories of my father come at the strangest moments."
"Time to pit steel against steel."
"Metal on metal. Let's get loud!"
"They have found me here. Let's settle this."
"Like magnets, we are drawn to each other to do battle."
"Oh, how I like a fair fight."
"The first wave is upon us."
"These creatures seek the living... even here."
"That smell... unmistakable. The Void.
"The Void has breached this place."
"Ah, trees... How I missed them."
"I return stronger than I left."
"I was spared for a reason."
"This place is beautiful... I'm going to save it."
"I like it here, I just might stay."
"It's a good day for a hunt."
"I came back for the others who could not."
"I came for the hunt... but I'll stay for the fruit."
"This skin is fashioned for survival, and honed by instinct."
"This skin lives on me, and hunts with me."
"This suit hunts in the manner I choose."
"Get up. Stand firm. Strike hard."
"Survival means never stopping—the Void knows that too."
"Void rule number one: don't die."
"Survival is an instinct we all have."
"A moving target lives longer."
"Monsters are everywhere."
"Exploit their mistakes."
"Exploit their weakness."
"Feed the beast... or be its meal."
"Hold our ground; attack them in theirs."
"Stay alert, stay aggressive."
"This is my purpose, learn from me."
"Forgiveness is hard... but so very worth it."
"It's fight or flight, only now I do not run."
"This world is changing... We decide into what."
"I can make a difference here."
"I will make a difference here."
"Are those peaches I smell?"
"Primary directive: kill."
"Secondary directive: maim."
"Tertiary directive: peaches."
"The hunt is binary. Kill, or be killed."
"The skin grows restless... It needs to feed. If it doesn't... could I be next?"
"Some recoil at the sight of me. Underneath the shell, would they see I'm just like them..."
"The Void consumes everything; leaving only emptiness in its wake."
"The Void will not consume me; but I must act, or the others will not be as lucky."
"Only a child... and no one came to save me."
"Imagine a place where it's always night and you're holding faith for a dawn that never comes. I don't have to imagine. I've been there."
"Down  there, I was surrounded by nothingness... but I was never alone. Memories comfort like the closest companion."
"When I was a child, I was frightened of what lurked in the dark. How silly I was. Now, I call it home."
"This place is too beautiful to be decimated by the Void..."
"I survived the Void—but here is where my story has its best ending."
"Maybe someday they will come to accept me. For now, they will need me."
"The monsters are coming. We'll be ready. I'll make sure of it."
"Look closely, and your prey will show you how to kill it."
"They need to listen to me. Then, they would see that I can show them a better way."
"I can rid them of these monsters... but who will save them from themselves?"
"This skin taught me how to survive. I will show it how to live."
"This second skin gave me a second life. I will not take it for granted."
"I survived the Void. I refuse to let death in. I refuse to accept it as my fate."
"...Tell yourself you will live. Believe it, Kai'Sa; and you will have a chance..."
"Fight hard. You are a living weapon."
"The hunting ground has changed... but the hunt is the same."
"Love... fear... whatever it's called—it's survival that motivates everyone."
"Life and death are separated by the smallest stumble."
"Let go of the anger. It does not serve."
"Anger is useless to me—a wound that will only continue to fester."
"Danger is real—fear is an illusion."
"I am the antidote, for the rivers of poison flowing beneath us all."
"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe; attack ships on fire on the shoulders of Or-- ...Are those peaches?"
"Technology doesn't evolve; it upgrades!"
"My suit AI will continue to learn with every kill... but it still could use a little extra battery life."
"My carbon fiber exoskeleton is invulnerable to micro-meteorites, re-entry, and the vacuum of space." Kai'Sa starts breathing heavily. "It has but one flaw: it can be a tad itchy..."
"So, this is what was before technology won. M'okay."
"I've been to the Void and back. You're nothing."
"This is why I came back!"
"This is why I survived."
"Just the beginning."
"One mistake is all it takes."
"Come on... come on..."
"Found your weakness."
"Let's see what you're made of!"
"I'll be your monster!"
"Fear the Void's sting!"
"I kill so they don't die!"
"Thick skin always wins!"
"Kai'Sa, remember the name."
"Time for an upgrade, rusty."
"Wow, time for an upgrade."
"Hextech is a dead technology."
"Human, or machine? Make up your mind."
"I guess I'm next, Jax."
"A lamp's not gonna do it, Jax."
"Settle down, sister."
"Something is off here."
"I know your tricks."
"You will leave this place."
"Not on my watch, glutton."
"Let's set the story straight."
"You call those guns?"
"You don't know what you're doing."
"You realize, we should be on the same side?"
"This, is not the Void!"
"You will die here, creature!"
"This is my home, Void-spawn!"
"This is my home, Void-spawn."
"You must be lost, creature."
"I am not afraid anymore."
"Go back, 'Voidling'!"
"You don't belong here."
"They can run, but they can't hide."
"That'll leave a mark."
"They never saw it coming."
"Running, is only half a plan."
"Marked by the Void."
"Prepare for what's next."
"Walked into that one."
"They'll think twice next time."
"They can't get away."
"That was pointless."
"Do better next time, Kai'Sa..."
"'Close' doesn't count."
"Dammit. Take your time, Kai'Sa!"
"Ugh, clumsy girl...!"
"That's a dozen for me."
"Thirteen—unlucky for them."
"Fifteen, and counting."
"And, seventeen. Wow."
"Uh-huh... Nineteen."
"Twenty-two! ...That's a lot."
"Twenty-five! Come at me!"
"You're now dead, prophet; that is the truth that will be told."
"I forgive you, Malzahar... but I do not forget."
"Goodbye, Malzahar, now I will tell this tale."
"The Void's reach is long."
"You can't outrun the Void."
"Only I can escape the Void."
"They were so close!"
"This is why they need me."
"Will they now see? I can do this!"
"That sent a message."
"That's just the start."
"Vision can make all the difference."
"They will come. We'll be ready."
"Let them come to us."
"That is just what I needed!"
"I won't forget this."
"Ahh, that's much better."
"Ohh, how I missed these!"
"What a pleasant surprise!"
"Sometimes, you have to stop and taste the... honeyfruit?!"
"Sometimes, you have to stop and taste the fruit!"
"Not peaches... but, they'll do."
"We're stronger together."
"Whew, that was close."
"Don't be long; we're stronger together."
"Don't worry, I will fight alone. I've done it before."
"I'll stand our ground while you're away."
"It's a trap—be ready."
"That's enough for the moment. The hunt will resume."
"I'll be back for more."
"I need to gather my strength." Kaisa breathes out.
"In the Void, I had no one; I was a doomed outsider. Here, people are everywhere—and they are all mine."
"The Void-spawn offer a thousand ways to die, and one way to live: become like them."
"I grew up deep inside a vast emptiness—I do not wish to grow old in one. That is why we must fight."
"The Void is not so much a place—it is a power, reaching out to consume all life.
"The things we carry should lift us up, not weigh us down. Memories, love, and hope... are the lightest necessities."
"The yoke of fear is a heavy burden. Hunters must be nimble, and walk lightly."
"Some call me 'monster'. They have no idea what lurks just below us all."
