"I have fur. It is soft. Do not hug me."
"If all goes well, our paths will never cross again. It never goes well."
"The best meal is a herd of cattle, with dark beer, and cherries... mmm."
"I made this hammer. It was so good I named it... 'Hammer.'"
"The  Freljord is a place for building, fighting, and eating. Home, sweet home."
"Name's Ornn. No further pleasantries needed."
"I will go over there. It looks quiet. It will be nice."
"I am going this way. Do not follow me. Please."
"I cannot choose my brother, only the weapons to slay my brother."
"Volibear is near... Everyone seek shelter!"
"It is childish to favor one tool over another! But Hammer is my favorite."
"Bah, look at all these lazy trees."
"Humans have done some things right: beer, dark beer..."
"My forge is my home."
"The last time I ate a plant was never."
"The Freljord forges men out of... whatever children are. Dirt, goblins..."
"'Ornn builds things, go see Ornn.' Nobody ever says thank you."
"Once a human kneels, they rarely stand again."
"Everything is better when it is molten; lead, iron, chocolate cake."
"Once I made a harpoon out of a mountain and a world tree. That was a weird century."
"Backbreaking labor is life's greatest pleasure."
"This world has potential. Needs hammering."
"I do not need company; only a wall, to keep out company."
"Gods do not need followers. Followers need gods."
"I had followers once. They tried."
"A day away from my forge is a day wasted."
"The other gods don't understand me. Hmph, good."
"My work speaks in the roar of flame and the ringing of steel."
"Luck is failure that failed."
"All I need is myself, and... Hammer."
"I enjoy being alone. Fewer unintended casualties."
"I will make an axe that is also a sword... and possibly a spoon."
"Solitude always meets my expectations."
"Could do without the statues."
"Hmm...  Noxian granite. Respectable choice."
"The architecture here is not wholly terrible."
"Huh, loose cobblestone. Will fix later."
"I did not want to cool off, but this feels nice."
"Volibear made the first river. You do not want to know how."
"Hmm, this river needs a dam."
"I don't know what you do and I don't care."
"Your base is that way! Go cower in it."
"Whatever you want, the answer is 'go away.'"
"I do not care at all."
"This is a waste of my time."
"Buy a joke book. And a clown."
"I now like you less. I did not think that was possible."
"You like that? I do!"
"This is called building character!"
"I have a hard head."
"Hammer never fails."
"Ahhh, hitting relieves stress."
"An iron will must be forged!"
"This will ring nicely!"
"The work is the reward!"
"I will hit you until minerals fall out!"
"Nose, meet grindstone!"
"Nose! Meet grindstone!"
"Fighting is my first language."
"I don't like the look of that thing."
"We never talk. Might as well fight!"
"Your sword has no counterbalance!"
"Give me the ale and no one gets hurt."
"My hammer is better."
"This is for my followers!"
"I taught  Doran everything he knows."
"Ornn tested, Ornn approved."
"I was looking at that one too."
"This does not mean we are friends."
"Do not hang that on a wall."
"If you want a weapon, here's a weapon. If you want conversation... here's a weapon."
"That is what good looks like."
"That's a weapon... you know, for fighting."
"I trust you know how to use that."
"You will not be disappointed."
"A good axe will fell a tree. A great axe will fell an army."
"The weapons I forge do not have names. They have ambitions."
"That is for wielding, not for entertaining."
"You may be worthy of that. Do not prove me wrong."
"I didn't make that. You didn't buy it."
"Huh. You are not entirely an arse."
"You remind me of a young me, who was less impressive."
"Working with you is almost like working alone. Almost."
"Something you should know about me..." Ornn grumbles.
"Your job is not dying."
"Well, that happened."
"It has not been a pleasure."
"Job done! Time to go home."
"That was more fun than I expected."
"That fixed everything."
"Build it again. Correctly."
"I've seen sturdier sandcastles."
"Too much sorcery, not enough elbow grease."
"It's always the magic parts that break."
"Honestly, though, I was just leaning on it."
"Heh, not one of mine."
"Easy build, easy break."
"A strong sneeze would've had the same effect."
"Shattered and melted."
"Mortal craftsmanship, please."
"Heheh, broke that real good."
"Whoops. Found a flaw."
"Whatever this drink is made of, it is working."
"Fuel for the old hearth-fire."
"Hmm, cherry flavored. Not bad."
"Heyyy, this is pretty good stuff."
"Hmm, that all it does? Okay."
"There, fixed that for you."
"Was like that when I found it."
"Early warning is key."
"Heheh! Broke it real good."
"Fine! I will intervene!"
"Don't start without me!"
"I'm on my way. Stop asking."
"You each owe me a beer!"
"You requested my aid!"
"My horns are on the way!"
"Efficient travel method. I approve."
"I swear, if Volibear is there..."
"I prefer walking... but, fine."
"Time to show them the horns."
"A fight's where I want to be."
"They won't be ready for me."
"A good workman is needed."
"Hmm, this is fast, but it can't be good for you."
"I broke my beard..."
"I didn't die. My forge missed me."
"Rekindled the old furnace."
"Still no water in the fountain."
"I'm used to this level of disappointment."
"Good job, everyone."
"Just leave everything to me, as usual."
