"It's okay, we'll play later."
"Workshop? More like playshop!"
"No more heroes! Now, it's crunchageddon!"
"It's Freljord Frost versus Azubu Frost!"
"Let's get in there and thwack some stuff!"
"This is just like in my favorite song! Only this time, it's about us!"
"Keep your eyes open for treasure. Like skulls or... rusty swords! Cool!"
"Sometimes the world's more interesting when you close your eyes. I see... globlins! Whoa, they have warts. That's how you know they're bad guys."
"The adventure continues!"
"Battle is the song I came to sing!"
"Make way for the yeti!"
"Someone out there needs our help!"
"This day keeps getting more bizonkerific!"
"You can't give up if you're standing on a yeti! That's as up as it gets!"
"Let's put the venture... in adventure!"
"There's nothing to it but to do it!"
"I bet we could have fun over there."
"Playtime's never over!"
"Let's make snow tracks!"
"Let's count our steps! Eleventy-seven and one, eleventy-seven and two..."
"Ughh, old people always doom the world, so it's up to kids to save it!"
"Before we can save the world, first we gotta see it!"
"Whoa! This. Is. Awesome!"
"Woah, too fast! The snot just froze to my nose!"
"Haha! Can't catch me!"
"The troll was fierce, his breath was cold. Not blood, but ice you would behold. To spill from wounds, the bites of steel. In flesh was hero's blade concealed! Being a hero is awesome!"
"The witch hissed as her spell was spun. And heroes raised their voice as one, 'For glory, for freedom!' They joined the fight, but their cries were trapped in darkest ice. Lissandra taught me that one!"
"Ice, wind, spray of souls. Lay of seekers, the elder toll. Locked for eons, a frozen key. The power lies inside me!"
"The gods are gone, the world their forge. Now flames are gone, and words our torch. Against the cold, this song I sing, a spark of my own forging! Well, technically my mom's."
"Steel flashed as it cut through air, and web guarding the spider's lair. Eight legs, covered in claws and hair. A web of danger, life ensnared!"
"Our caravan used to race Anivia all across the Freljord!"
"My mom said as long as I remember her, she'll always come back... like Anivia."
"Braum? I knew you were real! Will you be my dad?"
"I can be a hero too! I'll show everyone in the  Frostguard!"
"I hope Lissandra's not mad. Huh, her face might freeze that way."
"It's not how you die, Olaf! It's how you live! Even I know that!"
"Sometimes fighting can teach you things... like how to forgive your brother."
"Ornn! My mom used to sing your song as the ashes died in the fire. It still makes me feel warm."
"Definitely not a princess."
"Believe in yourself, Tryndamere, and you won't need to  call people chickens behind their backs."
"I wanna be a barbarian when I grow up!"
"Volibear! Uh, sorry. I mean, the Volibear. Or, uhm, Mr. The Volibear... sir..."
"The best part of being a hero... is shouting out your catchphrase!"
"And a little of that! Pow!"
"Don't make me come down there and bonk you myself!"
"Claws slash! Teeth chomp!"
"Saving the world is so much fun!"
"If we save the Freljord, everyone has to like us!"
"These bad guys aren't gonna bruise themselves!"
"Didn't anyone tell you? The bad guys never win!"
"What you're doing is wrong!"
"It's not fighting if you're having fun!"
"I have sworn to vanquish all kinds of bad stuff, starting with your face!"
"Something tells me they don't want a hug."
"Mess with the yeti and you get the boy!"
"I don't know what 'dastardly' means, but I'm gonna punch it!"
"No wonder they're so angry, they forgot to bring snowballs!"
"Lord Grompulus Kevin Ribbiton of Croaksworth, your unjust reign ends here!"
"The fairy's voice was coming from over here! I bet that Gromp swallowed her!"
"If you see a Krug's shadow, that means there's gonna be an earthquake."
"The frost troll will never leave the village if we don't get rid of the Krugs. He's scared to step on them."
"What a big beak you have, Mrs. Raptor. You're gonna use it to hurt people, aren't you?"
"I'm gonna play a song so loud these wolves will lose their stinky breaths trying to howl over me!"
"Murk wolves, I come to fight you in the name of your archenemies! Murk CATS!"
"The boy who cried wolf? That's not me! I never cry."
"Tell us what happened to the sentries, blue guy! Or someone's gonna get hurt!"
"Beat up a bunch of tiny goobers, then you can fight the boss!"
"We will banish you from this valley, rock-skin boulder-man!"
"A stone sentinel! He must be guarding something... like a secret!"
"The princess will never wake up, unless we can find a bramble rose."
"I heard what you did in Kumungu, Brambleback!"
"Brambleback! It was you all along! Well, your evil deeds end here!"
"I can do this. Huh!"
"Cloudy with a chance of dragon!"
"Infernal? Sounds evil to me!"
"You're in a mountain of trouble!"
"Can't be any worse than a sea serpent!"
"One dragon to rule them all!"
"I really... don't like monsters!"
"Songs aren't usually this... scary."
"This is gonna be the biggest snowball ever!"
"Gigantulossal snowball!"
"I just realized... Snowballs don't have brakes!"
"Ooh, one too many snowballs..."
"We didn't wanna hurt you, that's why we used snow."
"Hah... Magic tickles."
"You were gonna hurt someone with that!"
"Smell you later, bad guy!"
"Perfect timing! Must be from all the songs."
"Fairy? Are you in there...? Whoa. Disappeared!"
"Apologies, m'lady. We'll find a way to un-toadify you."
"May the crown pass to a more worthy Croaksworth. Like Tim! Or Jerry. Or Jeff. Or, um... hm."
"Phew! I've never Gromped so hard in my life!"
"That was a weird cure. I hope I read the scroll right."
"Frost troll! Your feet are safe now!"
"That was your mistake, Krugs. We never take evil for granite."
"That's what you get for teaching numbers!"
"Maybe now the wraiths can come home!"
"Oh no, you bit them, and now they're yeti-wolves! Awooo!"
"Sometimes blue is the only color in the Freljord. I remember my mom had blue eyes..."
"You shouldn't abandon your best friends!"
"Next time you'll remember, it's not nice to keep secrets!"
"Crumble under the weight of your infamy!"
"Now there's nothing but ash... evil ash!"
"But maybe it was  Ivern's fault."
"No flowers on this one! We gotta keep looking!"
"Yeah! Go back to the Void, ya crabbybutt!"
"They were just defending their home. Why don't the songs ever mention that?"
"Looks like we got... under his scales."
"Dragonslayers! That's us."
"I like watching clouds, but it's even better fighting them!"
"We beat up a mountain! Woah!"
"Some say, the beast's cries can still be heard whenever you taste purple."
"The  Freljord's greatest heroes on our way!"
"We're here to lend some fists!"
"Let's bury 'em in snowballs!"
"Fear not, fellow adventurers!"
"Buckle your tunic, we're going in!"
"Secret. Hero. Handshake! Yeah!"
"Best friends forever!"
"They lived happily ever, after all!"
"I didn't think you were dead! I could see you breathing!"
