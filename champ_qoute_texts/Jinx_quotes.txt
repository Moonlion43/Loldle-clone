"Rules are made to be broken... like buildings! Or people!"
"Aww, c'mon, what's the worst that could happen?"
"Whatever, let's just start shooting!"
"Aww, c'mon, what's the worst that could happen?"
"Now where was I? Oh, right, wreaking havoc!"
"Let's just behave... said no one, ever."
"What if I had a gun that... shot other guns?"
"I'm trying to care! But I just... can't!"
"Wait. I'm thinking...! Urgh... how do people do this?"
"Jinx? Stands for Jinx! Durr."
"She's such a loser, always ready to cry! Ta-ta-ta-taa!"
"I don't even think once about blowing stuff up!"
"I'm crazy! Got a doctor's note."
"All part of the plan I just made up!"
"Ask me if I'm listening...! Hint: I'm not!"
"I really need a new gun. But don't tell my other guns."
"Hold on! I'm about to say something really cool!"
"You think I'm crazy? You should see my  sister!"
"I have the best intentions!"
"What's in my violin case? Violence."
"Welcome to Snoresville, hat lady! Population: you."
"But where are your other guns, hat lady?"
"You're gonna chase me, fat hands?"
"I'm over here, fat hands!"
"Vi? Stands for stupid!"
"Three guns means never having to say 'I'm sorry'."
"I'm bringing guns to the knife fight! ...Hehe."
"Say hello to my friends of varying sizes!"
"Guns don't kill people. I mean, until you shoot 'em. Then they kill everything!"
"Fishbones, you know what we oughta do? 'Do the laundry, wash dishes and pay some bills.' Stupid dumb rocket launcher..."
"Maybe we should settle down and live peaceful lives. 'Really? I always hoped one day you'd--' Haha, nope! You're a death machine for life!"
"Hey Fishbones, think we can wreak havoc forever? 'No, you should buy a home and save for retirement.' You know I can replace you, right?"
"Hey Fishbones, should we blow something up? 'You might inconvenience people and hurt their feelings.' Ugh, you're the worst weapon ever!"
"You're starting to bore me."
"Duck! Hehe, just kidding, that won't help."
"Any last words? Ha! Heh. No, just die."
"Smile! It's called gun play."
"I accidentally did that on purpose."
"Tcha-tcha-tcha-tcha...!"
"Gotta die sometime!"
"You're my favorite waste of bullets."
"Seriously, screaming helps... not at all."
"No need to be scared—or alive."
"Stay still! I'm trying to shoot you!"
"You're not laughing...!"
"I'll give you to the count of—time's up!"
"I feel like I forgot to shoot something... "
"I've got a recital, and everyone's invited!"
"Scream along if you know the words!"
"I'll be right back! No one die screaming without me!"
"Three, forty-one, nine and lift off!"
