"Quest accepted! ...Wait, where are we going?"
"Hey, your loss. But I get it."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. World. Peril. Save it. I got it, I got it."
"Huh, could've sworn there was a hidden entrance around here somewhere..."
"Where there's treasure, there's glory. And where there's glory... girls are watching."
"Stick with me and you'll be fine. That's not a guarantee, by the way."
"Oh, please don't die. I can't lose a sidekick. Not again."
"To save video games, he had to become video games. Ezreal is... video games."
"I'm in my element, fighting evil. Life is good."
"When you've got talent, there's not such thing as a lucky shot."
"No plan survives first contact with me."
"Feels like the whole world's gone crazy. Right on schedule."
"Jarro Lightfeather never gives up. He learned that from me."
"Oh, a plan. Yeah, I totally have one of those."
"Once it's a ruin, I can legally loot it."
"I'm at my best when the world's on the brink of annihilation."
"The gauntlet's for show... the talent's all me."
"I rarely know what I'm looking for, but I always find it."
"There's an unspoken law in archaeology: finders keepers."
"Sounds dangerous. I'm in."
"True explorers follow the compass in their heart."
"I'm always open to new ideas. My new ideas."
"If I don't know the rules, then how can I be breaking them?"
"I. Never. Miss. But I have been known to fire a warning shot or two..."
"I hate the word 'steal.' I prefer 'liberate' or 'procure.'"
"Impossible comebacks are sorta my specialty."
"Exploration runs in my family. It's in my blood."
"What level am I on?"
"I'll beat this... 'League of Legends'?"
"Huh... where's the warp zone?"
"I'm rated 'E' for Ezreal.'"
"Woo! Just unlocked the 'Awesome at Everything' achievement!"
"Ez tanks, locked and loaded."
"Ooh, did I save my game before this?"
"Star Guardians for life! Except during Ezreal time. Gotta have my Ezreal time."
"Outshine everyone, and no one will see what you're up to."
"At least the First Star didn't put me in one of those sailor getups."
"The entire universe awaits us."
"If it's not made of stardust, it's not worth the effort."
"I can't believe they talked me into this."
"True Star Guardians never burn out."
"Gotta admit it, the uniform's growing on me."
"'Know your environment.' My environment... is wet and muddy and probably filled with leeches."
"Ugh... water's cold. AHH! Something touched my foot!"
"...And my boots are not waterproof. Fantastic."
"This reminds me of discovering the spirit tomb of Ekrin."
"I always know a shortcut."
"A beaten path is a boring path."
"No way to predict the twists and turns ahead. That's why I wing it!"
"Never met a problem I couldn't blast away with magic... that I don't even understand."
"It's not grave-robbing if you have a college degree. Which I do... *cough* not have a college degree."
"Yeah, we'll liberate a priceless artifact or two. Kill some bad guys. Maybe save the world. Y'know, typical hero stuff. It'll be great."
"I unearth the secrets of the past and sell them to the highest bidder. Does that make me a criminal? ...Don't answer that."
"Some people call me a hero. Their word, not mine. But it does have a nice ring to it."
"I don't read books about the world. I go out there and see it for myself."
"Nothing stops me. Except for Shuriman parasites. It was... not pretty."
"Little piece of advice: If no one tells you something's impossible, then it's still possible. So go do it."
"Last time I was in Shurima, I decoded some glyphs. Something about a... jackal head, end of times... the usual. I just wanted this ruby scarab. It looked great on my mantle."
"They really hate me in Shurima. And in Noxus. Demacia's lukewarm on me. Haven't been to Ionia yet, seems nice."
"I can't get hauled into wizard court again. Technically I don't have a permit for the gauntlet."
"Uh, I hold the speed-running record for Hyper Crystal Dungeon. This is nothing."
"I don't want to brag, but I'm somewhat of a cosmic sensation."
"Hmm, maybe I'll ask the First Star for a tuxedo... and some roses."
"Time to show 'em who's best. Spoiler: it's me."
"Don't make me put my goggles on. They're decorative."
"Hey, Ashe. I totally meant to return that Avarosan sculpture thingy. Is that an ice bow? That's a cool ice bow."
"A celestial dragon that throws stars. Well, this is totally normal. I can do this."
"Okay, Camille. Fork over that  Brackern Crystal."
"Woo! Strong goggles game, Corki. Keep it up."
"Aw, crap, I opened a mirror dimension again! ...Does my hair really look like that?"
"Giant petricite gargoyle. So it's gonna be one of those kind of days."
"Hey, brainface, you are why no one likes Yordle inventors."
"Can't manufacture magic in a lab, Jayce! Or good looks, for that matter."
"That mask is not art, Jhin. It's ancient history."
"Nope! I did not sign up for Jinx-level crazy."
"Hey, Lamb... is Wolf friendly?"
"Oh, I've heard of the  Black Rose. Nasty reputation... I mean, uh, huge fan!"
"Lucian! It's me... Jarro Lightfeather."
"I'm a mage. You're a mage. I'm blond. You're blonde. Doesn't it feel like we're made for each other?"
"Don't pretend you didn't see me, Lux. That doesn't work."
"Hi, honey! Is it too soon to call you honey? It's too soon."
"Your eyes really do twinkle like starlight."
"Pink looks good on you, Lux. I like it."
"Can you forge me a matching gauntlet?"
"Well, you are just terrifying, aren't you, Pyke?"
"So... Rakan. How serious are you and Xayah? Just asking."
"What the heck is that?!"
"Oh, c'mon! Sivir! I swear, I didn't know I was robbing your family's ossuary!"
"Throw some more rocks, Taliyah! I need targets to shoot!"
"Yeah, I get it. It's tough being handsome. Right, Taric?"
"Well hello, Xayah. You should know that I am pro-Vastayan rights."
"Hey, Xerath! How come you didn't get a cool Ascended animal body?"
"Gahh, I'm too young for you, Zoe. Cradle-robber."
"Zoe, you're ruining my chances with Lux!"
"Oh, cool. Great. They have an Ascended. This should be fun."
"Everyone! Watch your coin purses!"
"Darkin? We're gonna need a bigger army!"
"Jarro Lightfeather doesn't do autographs. Sorry."
"Listen, I have met exactly one Demacian I've liked. By the way, has Lux mentioned me at all? Just curious."
"Oh, okay, demigods! Well, universe, you seem to really want to screw with old Ezreal today!"
"Oh, please, we gotta deal with demigods?! I really need to up my rate."
"Demons? This is a job for Jarro Lightfeather."
"Noxians. I hate these guys."
"Why is it always about strength with Noxians? How about vulnerability for once?"
"Heh! Piltovans! Always think they're the center of the universe."
"Targonians... Hey, ten words or less, what exactly are you guys?"
"Shadow Isles... all that Black Mist has got to be protecting something really valuable."
"Shurimans. Always thinking I appropriated their cultural heritage. They're not wrong."
"Didn't expect unliving ghouls. Note to self: always expect unliving ghouls."
"Vastaya! Just like in Santangelo's field guide!"
"Yordles. Why'd it have to be Yordles?"
"I'm better than the First Star... Don't tell  Ahri I said that."
"Hey there, gauntlet! How ya doin', buddy?"
"Do I wear my gauntlet... or does my gauntlet wear me?"
"You belong in a museum!"
"Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. What are your weak spots again?"
"Sick burn... probably? Wasn't listening."
"Ah. Watch this... We will never speak of this again. Ever."
"There's somewhere else I gotta be. Literally anywhere else."
"This is no time for jokes. Your jokes. My jokes are great."
"Are you not intrigued?"
"Lot of good mages out there! None of them are this hot!"
"I'm not even breaking a sweat."
"Tell me the odds, I dare you!"
"I'll make this look easy."
"You're between me and glory."
"Haha, I'm allergic to caution."
"Magic? Comin' at you."
"Oh-ho! It is so on."
"Gauntlet, let's clear a path."
"No luck. All skill."
"Another day, another bullseye."
"Time for a true display of skill."
"All part of the adventure."
"Obstacle, meet gauntlet."
"Hard work? Not today!"
"I'm a professional."
"Hah! I can blink and still not miss."
"Embrace the cosmic light!"
"How 'bout a serenade?"
"Yuuto says you're ugly. I agree."
"Pick a timestream, kid."
"Hey Garen! How's your sister?"
"Red. That's fitting for you, Jinx."
"Heh, this is so us! Right, Lux?"
"This is flirty fighting."
"So, are you busy later?"
"Aim for the legs..."
"Leave Lux alone, Zoe!"
"I'm gonna send you back to... wherever Yordles come from."
"Stand back! Let an expert handle this."
"The uglier the monster, the more fun they are to shoot."
"Blast 'em, gauntlet!"
"Maybe next time I'll open an eye."
"That's what skill feels like. Hurts, doesn't it?"
"Oooh, that looked like it hurt."
"Nice shot, me. High-five."
"Can't learn that in a textbook."
"That was a, uh... that was a warning shot!"
"I blame the terrain. Totally that rock's fault."
"Must've ricocheted off a cricket or... something..."
"It wasn't a miss. It was a... near-hit."
"Gauntlet! You're embarrassing me in front of the bad guys!"
"Name's Ezreal. E-Z-... oh, you're dead."
"And Ezreal is victorious! Ahhh! Yeah!"
"Take five, everyone. I got this."
"And now, you're cosmic dust!"
"No applause, please! ...Okay, maybe just a bit of thunderous acclaim! ...A little?"
"Wow. That escalated quickly!"
"Good job, everyone. Let's, uh... just keep doing whatever you were doing."
"Cool guys never look back at explosions."
"Oooh, I hope that wasn't a world heritage site."
"I'll come back later and sift through the rubble for artifacts."
"Everyone see that? No? Damn! Now I've got to go and do it again!"
"They just don't make temple traps like they used to."
"Never act like victory is assured. Even though it probably is."
"If anyone asks, I didn't see any of these priceless artifacts for sale."
"That belongs in a museum. All of this belongs in a museum... I won't say anything."
"Don't worry, I'm not the magic artifact police. Wait, are you?"
"This is really worth ten times the asking price."
"Can I get an itemized receipt? My accountant's way too good at his job."
"Nice. You can send the bill to my uncle's museum."
"We mages call this a warlock exit."
"Ancient. Magic. Words."
"Relax. I blindly teleport long distances all the time!"
"Alright, guys. Don't miss me too much."
"Whoa. Time out, everyone! Don't continue the fight without me!"
"Don't attempt anything glorious in my absence."
"Back from the dead? That confirms it. I am a god."
"Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated."
"I'll be omitting that little mishap from the expedition logs."
"I truly hope nobody saw that."
"Ready for the best?"
"I let you guys off easy!"
