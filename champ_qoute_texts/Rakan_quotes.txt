"Seriously? Seriously? Lame."
"You see this cape? Ha! I say goddamn I'm sexy!"
"Nothing important should be taken seriously."
"We are seen dancing and thought insane... by those who can't hear the music."
"Okay, everybody, I'm here, I'm here... the party starts now!"
"My fellow travelers, you are all about to witness my majestic epicness! ...unless I get killed, but... probably not!"
"Xayah? Xayah? Crap. What was I supposed to do?"
"Consequences only matter if I don't get away."
"Magic is in the heart. Magic is in the rhythm."
"I can't wait to get in there. I don't know what I'm going to do, but I am going to get in there!"
"War is in the dance."
"Alright, let's go! This way or that way?"
"We always have a plan."
"Ugh, I hate everyone today."
"I know what'll make you feel better..."
"Murdering everyone!"
"If things go wrong..."
"They always go wrong."
"They don't always go wrong."
"They mostly go wrong."
"That's why I'm here."
"Hey, I have a plan."
"You... have a plan?"
"Yeah! I'll go on instinct!"
"That's the opposite of a plan."
"You sure about this?"
"So, this mission... are we, uh...?"
"Are you pretending to be dumb?"
"Well, I mean... I don't have to remember the plan if you do."
"When are we going to do this?"
"Soon, baby. Slow down."
"Okay, Rakan, get 'em watching you, then you burn 'em up."
"The humans call it battle. It's just a dance."
"Is my cloak right? Yes it is! I was worried there for a second."
"I dance because I'm free!"
"Humans made promises. More than I can remember. They kept none."
"I don't need to understand the plan! I trust my love."
"Ain't nothing I say should be taken seriously! That's why it's the truth!"
"Ha! I'm G to the D! Golden diamonds, boy! Woo!"
"I feel like my allies aren't recognising how amazing my cloak is! I mean, seriously! Rude!"
"I will make them dance. I will make them hear."
"They will remember my name!"
"Our magic is a fury. It is a song you cannot resist."
"It don't take a lot of words to tell the truth."
"Magic is supposed to be scary. Love is supposed to hurt. Ecstasy needs a little fear."
"Should I be... running? Yeah, I should... probably be running."
"It's magic that's wild. I'm just here for the party."
"Man, have you seen that forest over there?"
"Ladies and gentleman, I am here to entertain! Myself, mostly... but you too!"
"I am Vastaya. I am born of magic. This is my destiny."
"Danger is as fun as you let it be."
"Magic is a wilderness."
"Gotta get myself hyped, okay... one, two... one, two... woo! Alright!"
"They want us in cages. We refuse."
"You're only given a little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it."
"The humans will never understand our kind until they hear the song."
"I dance so fine I kill."
"Time to get it started!"
"I need my love to hurt. I need the world to be scary. I don't apologise for it! I feel good!"
"I do not wish to kill the mortals. I want them to hear the music."
"I'm going to take all they got, then laugh as I throw it away."
"I got my look right, I got my moves right... time to show it!"
"I will walk in. I will dance. They will party."
"If it don't get out of control, it ain't a party."
"Don't leave nothing! Bring it all!"
"I don't want a war, but I want to be free."
"I dance because I'm free."
"I'm getting impatient."
"They think they can catch me."
"They will see me. They will see my dance!"
"I have got to stop talking to myself. Damnit, Xayah, where are you?"
"This looks like another dangerous situation. Thankfully, I can improvise."
"What human's call magic, we call life."
"The only way to understand magic is to plunge into it, move with it, dance and dance!"
"I'm so fine, I gotta kiss myself!"
"For humans, magic is like fire. For us, it is water and air."
"I got freedom, I got a lady, I got a cause I'd die for. That's who I am."
"I think they underestimate my charm. How is that even possible?"
"I can't wait to see what I'm going to do."
"Magic isn't supposed to be safe."
"They're scared of darkness. They're scared of magic. They are scared of where I'm from."
"Crap. I totally forgot why I'm here."
"I'm just trying to live the moment."
"It's a revolution. And it's good times."
"They ain't ready for what I'm bringing!"
"I'm here! I'm gone, I am so gone."
"Name one genius that ain't crazy."
"I look around these forests and I see freedom. I hear the music."
"I'm gonna burn this place down, then help them build it back up... so I can burn it again!"
"Humans talk about their treaties. We talk about their lies."
"Long ago, our kind danced upon the mountains like flames. Now only the embers remain."
"Fun. I need some fun. Now!"
"They will see my dance, then they will know magic's joy... and its fury."
"Our people are bleeding. My lady's gonna heal them."
"I don't want a world that's safe."
"Humans claim it is theirs. They fence us away and cover it in refuse."
"I am only as wild as magic."
"They're gonna try and test me? Haha!"
"Humans think that to believe in something, you have to be serious about it. That's their problem."
"There's wildness in the bees and the flowers. It's just a fury humans don't see."
"If Xayah says someone has to die, they die. And they deserved it."
"They've never seen moves like mine."
"I'm gonna live forever!"
"I've been kicked around since I was born. It's alright! It's okay! I'm staying alive!"
"Xayah? Hey! Damn, where is she? I hate it when she leaves."
"It's all filthy and dangerous. And that's why I love it!"
"I can't die looking this good!"
"Without wild magic, we have no children, we have no future."
"I look good, I feel good, let's kick some ass!"
"I don't need anything, but the right now."
"The universe loves me."
"I am definitely more confident in dangerous situations."
"I am a chronic line-stepper."
"When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story."
"They ain't seen moves like mine."
"Ah... I miss Xayah."
"Woo! I am so into this! What is this?"
"Why is it taking so long to get back to the action?"
"I'm offended by how little attention I was given."
"If you aren't a little frightened, you ain't alive."
"Keep them distracted."
"That shouldn't be a problem."
"You're pushing yourself too hard."
"Where are we going?"
"You forgot the plan."
"No, I... yeah. Hey, have you seen this cape?"
"You remember the Aphae waterfall?"
"I'd like to go there again."
"Well, try not to die then."
"Pay attention to me."
"What the hell were you thinking?"
"I wasn't. I never think. Ugh... thinking."
"How can humans not hear the magic?"
"They're too busy building things."
"Because... they're afraid."
"Not saying 'I told you so.'"
"Okay, last time, it was totally my fault."
"You gonna marry me today?"
"Ask me again tomorrow."
"Do you love me because I'm beautiful, or because I'm sexy?"
"Another road, another horizon."
"It's gonna be okay."
"You know I love you."
"What we have is greater than some human word."
"Did you notice the sky?"
"Not as beautiful as you."
"Ugh, what's with the accent?"
"I'm... trying something new. Do you like it?"
"If you need me, whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?"
"No, that's not whistling."
"If you don't want to do this..."
"You're only here because of me."
"...nah. Freedom fighting is a good look for me."
"What are those things humans wear on their feet?"
"I need shoes. Red ones. I need them so bad."
"Did I tell you I love you?"
"Yes... but say it anyway."
"Why do you never say yes?"
"'cause then... I wouldn't get to hear you ask."
"Can we just stay here?"
"We must keep moving."
"Xayah? I think we got a problem..."
"I... know we got a problem?"
"You gotta rest, honey."
"Everyone is depending on me."
"What would you do if I died?"
"I would... burn this world to the ground and build a castle from the ashes, where I would live alone forever."
"Aw... that's sweet."
"I think scars are sexy."
"Okay. I'll get more."
"Wherever our hearts desire."
"How do you like me today?"
"More than yesterday, less than tomorrow."
"Do I make you happy, Rakan?"
"Every day of my life."
"I'm lucky to have you."
"No. I'm the lucky one."
"I swear, you will be the death of me."
"I'm fine with that."
"If we get separated, I'll find you."
"We won't get separated."
"You're already wandering off."
"No, I'm not! ... only a little."
"You are stunning and beautiful..."
"Why, thank you, darling."
"Yes. I was... definitely talking about you, honey."
"I need you to be more careful."
"If anybody's gonna die first, it's gonna be me. I can't see you die. Also, black is a terrible color on me."
"Baby, I don't do safe!"
"Oh, this is all so intense!"
"You can't tell me you weren't impressed!"
"Just generally! I'm amazing!"
"Honey, what are you doing?"
"I can't die looking this good!"
"After this, how about we get some human food?"
"We're eating chocolate!"
"Do you remember the plan?"
"Nope, but let's do it!"
"I have a cunning plan."
"Really? What is it?"
"I'm not going to tell you. That's the really cunning bit!"
"I think you intimidate human females."
"Should I show them the dance?"
"Show them the dance."
"You thinking about me?"
"That's very upsetting!"
"Baby, what did I tell you?"
"Did you see the clothes those guys were wearing?"
"I saw you. Everyone can see you."
"Yeah! That's what I like!"
"You want to start it off?"
"Let's start it off!"
"I'm a humble entertainer!"
"Yeah, I'm the best."
"Who is that gorgeous thing over there?"
"Now's not the time, darling."
"It's always the time!"
"Hey, I'm not gonna kill you, she is! Say hi, honey."
"I'm handling it, dear."
"How long do we fight?"
"Until we are free. Until magic is free."
"Is that after lunch?"
"Do you remember our escape route?"
"I'll take that as a no."
"How will we know if the plan works?"
"We'll still be alive!"
"Woo, shake those tail feathers, baby!"
"I am not a piece of meat."
"You used the secret call! Is everything alright?"
"We have a secret call? I just like that sound! Caw caw!"
"Hey, I need you here! Uh, never mind, just... go that way!"
"No one can control me!"
"That's right, babe."
"If I vanish, what would you do?"
"I would never be whole again."
"There's a surprise."
"Who can know these things?"
"You! You can know these things!"
"I know you're Vastaya, but your tribe... lacks style!"
"So, just tiger stuff? Buddy, you've got to mix it up."
"So, you just... run around in the jungle, huh? I mean, I'm not judging, if that's what you're into. Nerd."
"Is... 'totally bogus' your thing?"
"Hey, I'm right here. So, can you be less uptight and lame now?"
"You know, I ain't really about making fun of people, but you... make that difficult."
"Can we just get started already?"
"Why are you so boring?"
"Man, are you digging this air?"
"I got three rules. You're breaking two of them with that outfit."
"There's this thing called grooming. You should try it."
"So, when you got dressed this morning, was this the look you were going for?"
"Oh, you're bumming me out."
"I ain't gonna kill you. She is!"
"Nice to unmeet you."
"Give them a pretty last image."
"I think we're supposed to laugh, now?"
"Smile and nod, honey."
"Do you want to smell it? Not for you!"
"You want to smell it? No flower for you!"
"Man, that's insulting!"
"My palm sends its regards!"
"Try and hit me, fool!"
"You gonna take that from me?"
"Be silent and live."
"What you looking at?"
"Time to get started!"
"Let's get interesting."
"You will see my dance!"
"I got some moves for you!"
"Challenge accepted!"
"Time to go to work!"
"Where you going? Where you going?"
"I have killed for her! I will kill for her again."
"I'm gonna tear this place up!"
"We will not fade away."
"You're gonna love this!"
"This is you getting slapped!"
"I'm here! We can get it started!"
"They ain't ready! They. Ain't. Ready."
"You got something to say?"
"Am I not magnificent?"
"Am I not magnificent?"
"Here's what's happening!"
"Nothing's fun without risk!"
"Pay attention! Woo!"
"I got some moves for ya!"
"I'm gonna slap all of you!"
"Hey, what did the five fingers say to the face?"
"Look! I'm a distraction!"
"Want to see some sweet moves?"
"I can be very distracting!"
"What you looking at?"
"I like parties with a little violence!"
"I can't die looking this good!"
"I got one more thing for you!"
"You gonna feel this one!"
"You will see the dance of death."
"I need to get in it!"
"It ain't a party without a fight!"
"Oh! I need to get in there!"
"Hey! What you doing?"
"Let's get it started!"
"They gonna love this!"
"I'm gonna slap all of you!"
"Who... wants... to dance?"
"This is the message!"
"Hello? You ready for me?"
"Count it down! One, two, they dead!"
"You're gonna get hurt!"
"Damn, this is exciting!"
"Hey! I got a joke for you!"
"Hey, the party's over here!"
"This is all so intense!"
"Ain't gonna slow me down!"
"Woo! You animals are dumb!"
"Are you having fun over there?"
"I can't hear you over all the fun I'm having!"
"The fight's here!, by me!"
"It's the same fight!"
"I hate everyone today!"
"Should we give them a fighting chance?"
"Only if we want to have fun."
"This reminds me of our first dates!"
"Mind if I cut in, Rakan?"
"Be my guest, miella!"
"I couldn't miss it!"
"Make them remember!"
"They'll never forget."
"Let's show 'em what we got."
"You love it when I slap fools?"
"This is the plan, right?"
"What do you want to do later?"
"I can think of something."
"Can we talk about this later?"
"But... but... food!"
"Eyes on the prize, baby."
"Rakan is very enthusiastic."
"I want to show 'em!"
"I adore your energy."
"Do we need any of these fools?"
"How long since we last danced?"
"These guys look silly!"
"How many fights we gotta win?"
"That was beautiful, baby!"
"Whoops. Now you are dead."
"Step up again, I'll slap you down again."
"Come on, fool thought he could match my style?"
"Ugh. Sorry about that."
"I'm not about killing, but I'll put in the work."
"Also, your look is played out."
"I got the deadly fresh style!"
"The dance is deadly."
"Oh! Can't touch this!"
"Got a feeling I shouldn't have done that."
"Girl thought she could pull out my soul. But I got too much soul!"
"What was with that girl's dumb purse?"
"Big girl had too much going on."
"Problem with that guy? No talent."
"He had some style... for a human."
"Fool thought he could upstage me?"
"Was that a land shark? I mean, why? Why is that a thing?"
"Six legs. Still couldn't dance."
"Perfect predator? I got an instinct about how stupid that thing was."
"You were given Vastayan blood, yet chose to be blind."
"Power was not meant to be contained. Now, it is free."
"Another. Dead. Poser."
"Kind of feel bad for the guy. His feathers were weak."
"Punk was trying too hard."
"It is from our blood your gifts came, and my hand that took it back."
"One animal at a time? Weak."
"Hello, world! I am single now!"
"I bet she's gonna be angry about that later."
"I miss her already. Oh well."
"Well. I always was the pretty one."
"I find this parallel universe stuff very upsetting."
"You were a shadow without a flame."
"You thought you got away?"
"I remembered your trespass."
"Messed with my girl. What did you think I was going to do?"
"You came to visit us! Did you think we would forget?"
"Your kind started this war. We will end it."
"You put us in a cage? I put you in the ground!"
"I don't want to like killing, but this time, I did."
"We don't want your harmony! We want our freedom!"
"I showed you the dance. You should've moved."
"I'll just put that there. That's a good place. I hope. Yeah..."
"Vision is the first step towards understanding."
"I know people are watching. How could they not be?"
"Every road leads someplace."
"I need to know when the action's coming."
"I want to feel everything. That's the only way to live."
"Let's see what these animals can do."
"I live in the moment."
"Rakan, doing his job."
"I... totally forgot why I'm here."
"I am not blind to any possibility."
"When you open your eyes, you see everything is limitless."
"Aw, crap, I hate having to have a plan."
"Our kind will see the truth soon enough."
"The world's a big place. Don't want to miss any of it."
"Turn in, turn on, drop out."
"I should totally get paid for this."
"The sleeper must awaken."
"I dig seeing stuff."
"I need to see if people can see how awesome I am!"
"I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to scout around. Pretty, pretty sure."
"I'm going to show people some of the strange."
"Mankind is blind. I want them to see."
"I think Xayah told me to improvise. At least, that's the only part of the plan I remember."
"Yep, if I'm going to see the human world I need to start."
"Well I don't want to miss the start of the party."
"If you look at things the right way, it's awesome."
"Let's see what's happening now."
"Hello? Anybody there?"
"The world isn't about collecting stuff, it's about seeing stuff."
"Ah, it was nothing."
"Miella, I helped, right?"
"Couldn't have done it without you, mieli."
"Every time you do that, it drives me crazy."
"Well. I'll have to do it more often, then."
"Were... they trying?"
"Probably, but there are two of us."
"I love watching you kill."
"I love killing for you."
"Rakan, let's not gloat. Much."
"Did they deserve it?"
"Why do they break so easily?"
"They aren't made like us."
"That was a Vastayan farewell."
"Isn't a Vastayan farewell when you say, "ouulavaash?"
"I was trying to have a moment, Rakan."
"Did you see that? Haha! That was amazing!"
"They couldn't keep up with you."
"Only you can, Rakan."
"Mysterious mystery!"
"I'mma coming, I'mma coming!"
"Let's go! Baby! Baby? Baby? Baby!"
"You gotta keep up, baby!"
"Wanna catch a ride?"
