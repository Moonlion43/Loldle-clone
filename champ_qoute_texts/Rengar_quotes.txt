"A true hunter never rests."
"Monsters can be made to fear."
"I seek only the strongest."
"Walk the killer's path."
"A true hunter never rests."
"Comfort breeds weakness."
"Whose head shall I take?"
"There is the hunter and the hunted."
"I've found you, beast!"
"I see you, wretched creature!"
"You've earned a good death. I've earned the kill."
"You have a warrior's heart. I think I'll take it."
"So much bloodshed... This is my kind of place!"
"All these trophies... I'm gonna need a bigger den!"
"Their heads will adorn my wall."
"Carve off a souvenir."
"Nothing will escape."
"Let's see what they're made of."
"Another piece for my collection."
"I'm just getting started."
"Each trophy a victory."
"Remember every kill."
"More prey, more prizes."
"Spoils of the hunt."
"A token of my conquests."
"Never return empty-handed."
"Leave only a trail of bodies."
"What a glorious hunt!"
