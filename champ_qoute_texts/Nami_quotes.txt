"I decide what the tide will bring."
"There's always another wave."
"Quit flopping around."
"There's always another wave."
"Swim against the current."
"We are all tied to the ocean."
"Ride upon the waves."
"People and their air..."
"My people are counting on me."
"I still hear the song of the sea."
"I will see my home again."
"Afraid to get your feet wet?"
"Swim at your own risk."
"Sometimes you're the catch. Sometimes you're the bait."
"The sea holds fearsome creaturesâ€¦ and them."
"I moonlight as a shark caller."
"They're puddle monsters at best."
"Do not force my hand."
"The seas are rising."
"Welcome to the deep end."
"Let the seas reclaim them."
"This is minnow's play."
"The ocean will sweep them away."
"The sea has no pity."
"Ocean, spill forth!"
