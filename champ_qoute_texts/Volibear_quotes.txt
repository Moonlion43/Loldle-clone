"Feel the power of the wild."
"You have the heart of a weakling."
"The land will exist far longer than warm-bloods."
"The land belongs to the wild. Today, we reclaim it with tooth and claw."
"Their bones are ash and soil. Mine rumble with wild thunder."
"Follow me and we will bring down sky!"
"Gods do not beg. We take what is ours!"
"This ground will tremble with the first storm!"
"We are all blood of the wild."
"Men speak in small words. I speak in thunder!"
"To destroy is to free."
"What happens when old wounds heal?"
"I will roar the world into stillness... so must it be."
"Let the storm follow in my wake."
"Once, history was writ by tooth and claw."
"The creations of mortals fail. The wild remains."
"The soil hungers for blood."
"Hirnvel are sacred. Tree, soil, beast, blood!"
"My thunder shakes the foundations of the world!"
"Warm-bloods rose on two legs... and forgot how to run."
"Hmm. I taste iron on the wind... blood."
"The ursine speak for man and the wild responds."
"I carve my path with blood and bone."
"Ice hides the fury within."
"Battle boils the blood."
"Many have tried to end me. A god."
"I split mountains with my roar!"
"They have lost their wild. I will guide them."
"I will unleash the Freljord."
"When the night is cruel and dark..."
"Let the land thunder with my storm."
"This place has been tamed. I will untame it!"
"With each step I take, the wind gathers, and the Vrestrom grows!"
"In my dreams, I see bones frozen in ice. I wonder... if they are my own."
"When my brother gave them fire, they forgot the fire of their own blood."
"My sisters are gods of ice and salt and ever-winter. And Ornn? A liar."
"They have forgotten the old ways. The old ways have not forgotten them."
"My land was named by a god. It cannot be renamed by a coward."
"I am a god. I cannot die. But, do I live if I am not in the hearts of warriors?"
"Even in a cowardly man, the heart is wild. That is why it must be eaten last."
"I am Valhir of the first thunder, destroyer of the white mountain, carver of the five Fjords!"
"Darkening clouds. An omen to those who stand against the wild!"
"They call me Valhir. The Volibear. Greatstorm. My true name is mine alone."
"The land slumbers, but it is not dead. With my roar, I wake it. With my thunder, I call it."
"Clouds are the storm-cloak I wrap around my fur."
"Many have called to me. Avarosans. Frostguard. Winter's claw. They call no longer..."
"Raise your idols. Huddle beneath your stone trees! Today, I tear them all down."
"Bones crunch. Blood drips. This is the way of old Vorrijaard."
"My blood is of the Vorrijaard, the land before the Freljord."
"I still taste their ancestors... stuck between my teeth."
"Your gods are cowards!"
"You? Such a feeble sacrifice."
"Your towers will splinter like rotten teeth!"
"I was uprooting towns when your elders were crawling."
"Sister. How long can you endure the ice burning in your heart?"
"My sister. Together, we would harness a storm to consume the Freljord!"
"Your war-mothers do not know true war, Ashe."
"I knew Avarosa, Ashe. Just as foolish as you."
"The heart is strong, Braum. And tastiest after battle."
"Braum. You have the lip fur of a lowly cub. Half of it is milk!"
"You have no power here, young witch."
"The heart of a child is untamed. Violent in its hope... cruel in its despair..."
"You've gone soft, brother. Too much cake."
"You emerge from your mountain cave, brother. Let us end this."
"Ornn. You once denied me your weapons. Now, I no longer need them."
"Brother. You have lost your strongest weapons. They wither, and decay..."
"Rengar! I heard of your hunt. And I heard of your failure."
"Tell me, Rengar. Do your trophies make you stronger, or do they weigh you down?"
" Bristle! Why do you bow to this weak-willed warm-blood?"
"Hmm. You think you can be savage, Tryndamere?"
"What a-what is that? A cub?"
"Do you have something against bears, old man?"
"Play at rage, warm-blood. I will taste the fear quivering in your guts."
"Show me your baby fangs again. How dear."
"The first river was a river of blood! What has my brother been telling you?"
"Live for a few centuries and you will try everything at least once."
"It is better than staring at dirt."
"Tremble at my roar!"
"Your shrines will fall!"
"I will not be forgotten!"
"Blood, hahahaha, always tastes the same."
"You mean to kill me?"
"Ever-winter take you."
"You cannot tame lightning."
"You cannot kill a storm."
"Skulls, spines, always crunch."
"Truth lurks in a warm-blood's guts."
"A thousand scars, what is one more?"
"The ground is sown in blood."
"Vrestrom consume you!"
"A feast for the Earth."
"Blood. The way of the land."
"Such a death. Far greater than your life."
"I feast on your heart."
"Your lies feed the soil."
"Another coward dies."
"My sister. May you return on swift wings."
"Ornn's blood on my claws. Surely, there was a reason... Surely, this is just..."
"Oh, brother... Your forge is empty and cold."
"I unmake your shrines!"
"Beneath this stone I sense no wild."
"Down with false idols!"
"Nothing but rubble!"
"I hear them calling Valhir. The Vrestrom answers!"
"The storm gathers, and I enter sky!"
"Storms dance upon the soil."
"Born... in war... I fall... in war."
"I...! Do... not... die..."
"I rise, wreathed in lightning!"
"Whose heart calls the storm?" Volibear growls.
