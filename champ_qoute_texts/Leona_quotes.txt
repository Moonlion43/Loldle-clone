"The dawn has arrived."
"Stay at the vanguard."
"First light approaches."
"The sun always rises."
"I will protect you."
"The day is upon us."
"Pen or swordâ€”the shield is mightiest."
"Next time, try to leave a dent!"
"Feel the sun's glory."
"They will be sundered."
"I will break their line."
"They'll have to get through me."
"Day breaks upon the battlefield!"
"You'll pay for your heresy, Diana!"
"Alas, the sun sets once again."
