"The Isles will bloom again!"
"Your reckoning will come either way."
"Life can come back, once the earth is turned."
"Hold tight, my sapling."
"Beset by spirits, my home laid to waste!... And they call me twisted."
"The water of life succumbed to death. The mortals will follow."
"Fight for the saplings!"
"Drink deep of what magic remains."
"If I am already lost, I will take them with me."
"Flee into the forest? I am the forest."
"Mortals irritate me, like an itch beneath my bark."
"I will punish their wickedness."
"What have you wrought, mortals? What have I?"
"My heartwood is pure."
"I will end this misuse of magic!"
"Every step, defiance!"
"I cannot stop—the forest needs me."
"We must pull up our roots; darkness corrupts the land."
"I will fight for every pebble, every blade of grass."
"Living or dead, they are all the same."
"The Mist haunts my every move, yet I resist."
"Once they were human. Now, they are only in my way."
"Life here existed in a time before death."
"Now, where did I put that sapling...?"
"They trample life! I will trample them!"
"I will show them what was lost in the Ruination."
"Once my limbs reached for the sky, now for nearest mortal neck!"
"A shadow has fallen, as men have fallen."
"I cannot find peace! Not even in the smallest branch!"
"I once had peace. It is better to have purpose!"
"There is beauty here, even now, in the human's fear."
"Stillness is not peace! It is death!"
"I do nature's bidding... to the very end."
"The green in these plants, it is something I have lost."
"I can watch the mortals doom themselves from here."
"The young sprouts beneath my feet... they tremble."
"Nature conceals darkness."
"Once more into the grass."
"There is life still untouched by the Mist."
"I'd like you more if you were a fox."
"You create only destruction, Star Forger."
"You make me glad I don't have ears."
"Strength starts in the roots—and you have none."
"Oh, what mortals will do for beauty. Kill, and wear pointy shoes."
"Stop putting web in my branches!"
"I hear your skittering, mortal."
"You give sticks a bad name—and fiddles too!"
"Demacia's walls will not stop the Black Mist."
"One of many shadows on the Isles. The Shadow of War."
"Trample that blade of grass, horseman. I dare you."
"Only men seek redemption."
"Make like a tree and vacate the area."
"The sapling of the god Willow."
"A voice follows this one! A song, like those in the Mist!"
"It is the Isles that were betrayed!"
"Spirit of vengeance? And what of the forest?"
"The saplings wish to hear your dirge. Please, sing it... while I destroy you!"
"The song of life, now silent."
"You make me glad I don't have ears."
"I am no abomination!"
"The forest clings to life, and you would end it!"
"I am no abomination!"
"The forest clings to life, and you would end it!"
"Another pile of bones wearing a crown."
"Rival to the Ruined King—in ruin."
"Darkness gathers on the Isles—from every depth."
"Beware the mortals' gifts."
"You make me glad I don't have ears."
"A lantern? Ha! The forest is very dark indeed."
"It is torture enough being near you, spirit."
"The soul of the Isles is lost—beyond your grasp."
"The Isles have forgotten more than just your name."
"So you're what passes for a hero among the fleshlings?"
"You would scour the Isles without planting a seed."
"Have you ever tried to dig through roots? Good luck, human."
"A dangerous bloom, that one."
"It was a mistake to become human. You will share their doom."
"You forgot your roots!"
"The most beautiful flowers have the sharpest thorns."
"An axe is no danger if I cut you down first!"
"Magic came from nature, and will return to nature."
"To bleed the bloodless."
"Come and meet your end—and... a sapling or two."
"Your existence was not meant to be."
"There is still life enough within me to grant you death."
"Yordle... Stay out of my trunk!"
"The seeds of your destruction!"
"The sapling does not fall far from the treant!"
"In the end, darkness destroys itself."
"I am nothing like you! I can't be!"
"For the forest to bloom, I will tolerate your presence."
"Impressive words—but I'm a tree. I don't care."
"Are you going to Treemoot this year? I'm going to dress up as a sassafras!"
"I fight to free you as well, though a hatchet would suffice."
"Silence, mortal. You only give voice to darkness."
"This power is mine to command."
"The blessed waters turn within me."
"In the end, they all scream!"
"Protect what is pure."
"Bones break before branches."
"To find life, I will snuff yours out."
"Where men fall, saplings rise!"
"How my branches groan!"
"Once this land knew solitude."
"Life feeds on death!"
"Torment at your peril."
"Life torn from your grasp."
"It is in my nature."
"There is rot within!"
"I'll show you 'twisted'!"
"The trees have learned violence."
"So much life, stolen!"
"Vengeance may be hollow, but so is my trunk!"
"It is good to ungnarl my limbs."
"Your life bloom fades!"
"You defile the grove!"
"This will leave splinters!"
"Seek the forest's foes."
"Give them room to spread their leaves!"
"Greenfather, my sapling wishes to meet you."
"The Greenfather spreads life. The Mist will end it."
"Careful, my sapling. Ivern is watching."
"Does this make you uncomfortable, Bramblefoot?"
"To rest, if only you could."
"You would fight the forest in the forest?"
"Mortals always invading."
"Blood makes the grass grow."
"I would end your burden, but it always returns."
"Vengeance bears the sweetest fruit."
"Enough bark, and there's no need for a bite."
"Pruning dead branches; and odd ones."
"A friend of the forest no more."
"Begone, vile spirit!"
"The Isles will be cleansed!"
"I wondered what happened to that tree."
"I do tend to punch things."
"From a land where the trees are hardy and tall... and very, very cold."
"To strike a blow for nature."
"Burn through the Mist."
"Is it woven from branches? I can never tell."
"To aid the waters within my wood."
"Flee, my saplings... "
"The maelstrom has not ended!"
"I rage against this curse!"
"Didn't even notch my trunk."
"Another blade stuck in my bark."
"Do not defy nature!"
"So this is what they call getting stumped."
