"Now, hear the silence of annihilation!"
"Pantheon, I see you! Like a lamprey you attach yourself to a host! I will carve you from this mortal's form, and eviscerate you both!"
"Targon sends an aspect against me? Prepare yourself, Pantheon, I will end all that you hope to be!"
"Pantheon! I will crush your godhood, I will eviscerate your ideals, even your memory... I will trample!"
"The true sound of my blade can only be heard when they loathe re-incarnation."
"The only peace I seek... is death!"
"They will call me villain... Come, let me earn their hatred, again and forever."
"There is a darkness in my heart deeper than any shadow!"
"March toward vengeance... Drown this world in blood!"
"Patience, Aatrox! Patience! Your freedom will come!"
"For my imprisonment, they will suffer!"
"Challenge me, mortals! I am here!"
"They think me defeated, enchained. But I am unbowed... Noble is this carnage."
"Primitives worship me, hoping for mercy. I shall give them death."
"I will drown them in oceans of blood!"
"I will snuff out the light, I shall make darkness eternal!"
"I am oblivion, I am destruction... I am doom."
"I march to death... Though I wish it was my own..."
"My suffering... I will make it bloom."
"I must destroy even hope."
"I will render these mortals' forms into my own!"
"Gods and mortals, they deserve only death!"
"As long as this form lives, I will punish them."
"I stood against the void. Now... I would welcome it."
"This cursed form... This crude decaying flesh! I loathe it!"
"I am your reckoner, mortals."
"They will call me a god killer!"
"Am I the abyss? Or did I gaze into it?"
"Kneel mortals! So I may split your shoulders from your spine!"
"I am not a king, I am not a god, I am... worse..."
"We had another name once... Now, we are Darkin."
"My darkness was not born, it was forged by my prison."
"All that lives, I will end!"
"Those who call me enemy, I welcome them."
"I cannot die... until all life ends."
"Carnage, hate, yes! I am the World-Ender!"
"Behold, the World-Ender!"
"Death to all! The World-Ender awaits!"
"Now, I am the World-Ender!"
"I bring silence! I am the World-Ender!"
"This is the time, the World-Ender is here!
"Quiet yourselves, the World-Ender is here!"
"I am Aatrox, I am the World-Ender!"
"There is no escape from the World-Ender!"
"I am ready to be the World-Ender!"
"Bow worms! Bow before the World-Ender!"
"See your World-Ender!"
"Insects, the World-Ender has come!"
"Take everything from them! Become the World-Ender!"
"How far I have fallen! A god... reduced to a prisoner!"
"See what beasts they have reduced us to... Creatures of flesh sustained only by this filth's blood and form!"
"The heavens, the endless skies folding into each other. Where are they now?"
"I am in a cage within a prison... But this foul shape reminds me of my purpose!"
"We march to battle... Let me carve flesh, let me cloak myself in the slaughter! Hide me in their carnage... Hide me from this suffering..."
"I beg, let some challenge me today... So that I may tear out their hearts! Pray! Let me watch them die, eyes knowing they served... my dark purpose..."
"Cleave through them, Aatrox! Crush their skulls! Shatter their ribs! Disembowl their very souls!" Aatrox breathes heavily. "Our vengeance is at hand!"
"Dark deeds I will do this day... Though I will carry myself as my former pride dictates!"
"Every dream is a candle I must snuff out... I... am the darkness..."
"They sing of love, hope and gods, all that makes them want to live! So, I will quiet that first!"
"I have no goodness left, it was taken from me, stolen! I... am the nemesis of life."
"From entire villages and towns, I will rend the flesh... Until I stand... as an unholy god."
"March flesh, march toward them! We have horrors to sow! Lives to reap! Let me make them regret... being free."
"I touched the stars, and saw the glorious light of a thousand suns! Now, blinded by this elegance, how could my purpose be anything... but dark..."
"Tricked into this existence... False slave entrapped by endless life! I shall become a beast feeding on their destruction, and making them lament my unholy birth!"
"Once in noble battle, I screamed against the silence. I stood as light against the darkness. Now, I serve a new master... oblivion..."
"To war, Aatrox! They shall not rob us of our nobility! We shall stand, and spit venom at our tormentors for eternity!"
"Let me tear their flesh from them. Let me break their souls... And murder their dreams."
"Where I was excellence, I am deformed... Recast poorly with these crude materials. But this abomination of flesh well serves my murderous intent."
"I shall take their limbs. I will reap their beloved! I will tear from their consciousness, the will to live. Yes, this is my purpose."
"I am but an unholy copy of life... A mockery of its freedom... And born in the cruel betrayal of the noble ideals I would've served."
"I shall regard their cries as braying steeds, waiting to be whipped, broken, and bridled!"
"I shall not kiss the ground, nor let myself be wielded as a tool! I am damned, but I will remake this world in my dark image!"
"I do not obey! I cannot lay down! I will be the ender of all things!"
"Pray, fool! You face a Darkin."
"This violence shall amuse!"
"Do you see my edge?! Your death awaits!"
"Come closer! I will show you... darkness!"
"Tricks, Akali? They will not hide you from me, face your doom."
"Another foolish god, even the phoenix shall end."
"Scissors for legs... Okay, I thought I had seen stupid designs before... Alright, let's go."
"Look at your noble courage, Darius! Now learn... despair."
"You are unloved, Mundo! Now, face judgement!"
"I know your name, Fiora. This is not a duel you shall win."
"A statue? Rock shatters as easily as bone! Come!"
"Guns and oranges? Are you a clich√© or a joke? Come! Fight! Die!"
"Scream 'Demacia', Garen! Scream its name before I crush you, and it!"
"I kill gods, priestess. Let us continue this fight... until all things stop!"
"A worthy vessel! Come, Jax!"
"You would rush towards me, Kai'Sa? What fool would build a strategy on that idea? Come, let us begin."
"Let me show you your error, Kayle! You are not worthy of ascension! You, are not worthy of the worms!"
"I did not think my fellows weak, Rhaast! Already you disappoint me!"
"Ooh, a shadow warrior! How edgy!"
"I chose a sword, the noblest weapon, Rhaast. You- seriously, I don't understand... Were you trapped in the gardening section?"
"A scythe? A scythe?! Are you planning on murdering fields of wheat?!"
"Are you a joke, you loud, horrible thing? I shall kill you and your steed!"
"Where is your head, rock thing? Where is the neck I shall sever?"
"Am I challenged by a tree?! Fine, let me build a pyre from you!"
"You would bind yourself to this realm. Morgana? Fine, let me show you the ground!"
"Nasus, is your wisdom enough to know your fate? I am your death!"
"Your noble purpose amuses me, Nautilus! Fight me, see true death!"
"Hail Pantheon! How noble and proud he carries himself! Come betrayer! Come fiend!"
"Hail Pantheon! Let me hear you cry of friendship! Let me hear you scream of brotherhood!"
"Hail Pantheon! See the weapon I have become! Watch as you are destroyed!"
"Renekton! In your madness, you know my suffering! Though I shall end yours."
"Riven, dance, child! That broken blade is no match for me!"
"You would challenge me in a machine? You are a strange spirit, Rumble."
"A spirit blade, master Shen? Test it against me, let me shatter your illusions!"
"Yes Sion! I kill even that which will not die! I end all things!"
"Hail the protector! Hail Taric, aspect of- get a haircut!"
"Cowardly spirit, how annoying you are! I will savour killing you, Teemo!"
"A troll king?! Come! Defend your throne, king of trolls!"
"Rage? You are just flesh, Tryndamere, ready for harvesting!"
"I wait for you, Tryndamere! Come, take your vengeance!"
"Varus, 'V' 'A' 'R' 'U' 'S', your name should have an 'A' and then another 'A', Varus. There was a memo, Varus, there was a memo!"
"We all agreed on the double 'A' thing, Varus. The double 'A' thing!"
"You would end worlds? As a bow?!"
"I will not send you to death, Yorick! I bring oblivion!"
"I know it was you, trickster! You gave them the tools to trap me! Come, let me kill you! A thousand times isn't enough!"
"I will find a way to tear down the heavens and reveal you as fiends! Not today obviously..."
"Do I resemble you, abomination? Your form isn't my destiny... is it? You don't know how to talk, do you?"
"My will... is beyond death!"
"I am Darkin! I do not die!"
"Behold, immortality!"
"Mastery? I must congratulate you, obviously your parents never had reason to."
"Yes, your mastery is the master of masters! I am fighting... an imbecile..."
"Somehow, I doubt you've mastered self-esteem."
"Mastery, how I idolise your greatness! Though I suspect your weapon lacks... impact."
"Ah, mastery, well done! Now master your insignificance."
"I am like a demon, but more edgy, right? You know, cause I'm a sword. Hmm..."
"So uh, I'm Aatrox. I'm a transcendental being trapped inside cutlery... What's your deal?"
"Uh, nice world you have here. I intend to destroy it, you know, FYI."
"Your annihilation beckons!"
"Hear this cursed form sing!"
"Carnage is my method."
"Suffer, as I suffer!"
"Violence... distracts me from these chains!"
"I am Darkin! Your gods fear me!"
"I will hack and chop and cleave, and sunder the filth of your forms!"
"I begged for death, now I am its bringer!"
"Fight! Join me in death!"
"You would fight me?! Come, let me show you hell!"
"Sorrow... I shall deliver it to you."
"I am not your enemy, I am the enemy!"
"I will sever your limbs! I will carve your souls!"
"Carnage... Ohhhhhh..."
"I am the god killer!"
"Come, let me show you darkness!"
"I can smile, and murder while I smile."
"I come for you, Pantheon."
"The power of an aspect, wasted on a fool!"
"I killed your tribe. Now, join them!"
"Tryndamere! This is your destiny!"
"I will gut you, and tear you from existence, trickster!"
"Aspect of change! Now you die!"
"Follow me into destruction!"
"I offer you victory!"
"Fight! Or be forgotten!"
"Let blood be our sacrament!"
"I will have silence."
"I sing only in your deaths."
"This is your absolution."
"Resurrect! Return! So I may kill you again..."
"I brought you the one true gift, I brought you... death!"
"This is my gift to mortals."
"Carnage, my last joy."
"Your broken form speaks only of failure."
"To the end of times, I shall kill you again and again."
"This is the silence I seek."
"This was reckoning."
"I do not need to show my mastery, it is self-evident."
"What foolish plan bore a woman such as you, Camille? You were a folly, crafted by an idiot."
"The axe suited you, Darius, the weapon of a simpleton!"
"I expected you to be nimble, Fiora. Too easily, my blade crushed your spine."
"Yo ho, Gangplank, yo ho."
"In time I will learn how to kill even your god, Illaoi!"
"I cannot know if I was corrupted by the void, but at least my choices were not asinine."
"Die, Kayle, knowing your potential will never be reached."
"I cannot have brotherhood with incompetence."
"What is property? Why did this dead hamster want me off of it?"
"I kill mountains, Malphite! Dumb piles of rocks!"
"Hear me, tree spirit. Your form is but kindling, and your forests I will burn!"
"You disgust me, Morgana. Die in the filth of your bound flesh!"
"Yes, Shurima was meant to fall, Nasus, as were you!"
"Journey back to the deep!"
"Ornn, like all gods, you disappoint!"
"Pantheon, you crawl forward like a worm! Ready to be squashed again?"
"Now your body matches your blade, Riven: broken and worthless!"
"Die, Shen, knowing the Eye of the Twilight is blinded and plucked."
"You fought to live, Sion, yet it is I who am still alive. This at least amuses."
"Lord of starlight, lord of hair! I trample on your corpse, Taric! I spit on your aspect's purpose!"
"A spirit for cowards, I laugh at your tricks and mushrooms!"
"I thought you my next vessel, Tryndamere. Pity, you failed even to become a slave."
"Return again to your prison, Varus. Think upon your worthlessness!"
"Honestly, a bow and two boys? What was your plan, Varus?"
"How I loathe your freedom, trickster! I will take this vengeance upon you, until the end of times!"
"Insects, you think you can kill me? Behold my curse!"
"You cannot destroy me!"
"I... am not a mortal!"
"Did you think you could kill me?!"
"You think you can kill me?"
"As long as life exists, as long as time has meaning, I am not done!"
