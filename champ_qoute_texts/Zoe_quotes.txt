"Yes! This'll be fun! Right?"
"No, that's not nice!"
"Aww, I can hear my favorite wittle space doggy."
"I think we're gonna get to play with the cosmic space dragon. He's funny, but he needs better manners."
"Space dragons are so arrogant until you train them. We're gonna train this one."
"Hi Ezreal! I mean— that is you over there, right? I'm over here. I'm Zoe... Never mind.
"Hey, I'm Zoe! You're Ezreal! I know that! I mean— uh, I found it out! I mean... Awh, kill me now."
"Something good is going to happen. With sparkles!"
"Trickster never loses. Because Zoe changes the rules."
"Ugh, Targon has rules, but blehh, I'm gonna hang out anyway."
"♪ I wanna wanna, go to some place, place place. ♪"
"Dusk and dawn are the same. So there's actually two of me. Orrr I could be totally lying."
"I'm gonna dance in my superpants. Cause otherwise I would be naked!"
"I like all these things around me! The creatures. And... and the plants!"
"Are we done in this reality yet? Hello? Hellooo?"
"I should figure out a new game. One that mortals can play without dying!"
"Do not look into the eyes of a god, or fly into its ears."
"The eye that looks ahead for the safe course is closed forever."
"No one free is afraid of... mischief."
"I wonder who's around."
"Y'know, there's not enough unicorns here!"
"The wheel turns, day becomes night... time to make colors!"
"I hope this world survives... I like it!"
"Aaand a skip-skip and a jump-jump!"
"If this wasn't so pretty, I wouldn't care that it's all about to change."
"Time is a tide. All that it gives, it also takes."
"I should come here every millennium! I like it!"
"♪ I wanna have fun and chat with someone besides myself! ♪ I am a good listener though."
"Well, this is a pretty chill reality."
"Starlight is an expression of something inside bursting to get out!"
"Every day, every season... ends. And begin something new!"
"I am supposed to give them a message! But I forgot the sonic pattern for it..."
"There is mischief in the stars. Also gas clouds. They smell like farts."
"Daylight is too bright, the night is too dark, I want more colors!"
"♪ Things totally change so they can be the same but also totally different! ♪"
"Hmmmm... What do boys like?"
"I'm gonna hack the government later. But first, jump-roping!"
"I thought my VR rig wasn't working, but this is pretty swank!"
"This virtual reality is so lifelike! I wonder if anyone's in chat. Hello? Hellooo?"
"Alt reality online. Time to berf the gerf."
"I like this virtual reality, especially its lack of network security!"
"This simulation is pretty cool!"
"Every system has a weakness. We're going to find it!"
"Every apparent vector is actually parallax! Here it's just waaay more so."
"Let's de-encrypt this whole reality!"
"Man, they totally should've put this place in hybrid encryption, but they didn't!"
"Math is beautiful. All around us is beautiful math we can remake the world with!"
"I'm called Zoe, but it's just my smurf handle."
"Did I remember to run script? Oh dang!"
"Ooh! These VR auto-render foliages are amaze-o!"
"I can't believe this whole thing is procedurally generated!"
"I speak of the changes coming. That is our purpose. ...It's a pretty easy job."
"Nobody has to grow up if they don't want to. Orrrrr maybe they do. I don't, though."
"I'm not boy-crazy! I just... don't have a boyfriend yet."
"There are holes in reality. And... in donuts."
"When the beings here look up, do they think we're looking back?! We really aren't."
"♪ Here we go on an adventure, through this place! Even though we don't know the name of it! ♪ It doesn't matter!"
"There are so many weirdos here... It's awesome!"
"The sun and moon rise in time, to ash and mirth. The mountain takes... all. Change comes."
"Hey guys, so, cosmic change time, possible armageddon, twilight of the gods, blah-blah-blah — you've been heralded."
"There is a day we must all fulfill our destiny. ...That day is taco day!"
"There's this illusion of the reality, but it's not really really real, like it's beside and inside and inside and beside, but never on top... Nevermind, just kidding, but not really.."
"Hello? Hey, I'm over here if you want to aim a high-velocity attack against me! Maybe you'll hit me this time!"
"The sky is billions of explosions burning far away! How could you not wanna see them?? I did. They were pretty cool."
"Ohh! I like how the atmospheric refraction is favoring intense short waves today!"
"I bring a message for you all: a warning, a sigil. But first, I wanna see the sparkle flies."
"So, there's these, like, yinger and yangerons, and they spin in this projected pattern which intersects fourth-dimensionally. But it isn't a measurable function. It's got a whoosh, whoom, whoooooooooh!"
"The sky called to me. So I went! It was pretty cool. I like this too, though."
"Psst! Hey! Can you tell me your secrets? I promise not to tell them to... everyone!"
"Anyone wanna go into that ankle-deep liquid? Hello? Hellooooo!!"
"We don't try to understand the sense it doesn't make, so we're trying to share that with you. You're welcome."
"This will be fine! Don't worry about it Zoe, things break all the time. Like reality, planets... y'know, stuff."
"I didn't even know boys existed! Now I just want one to hold my hand and look in my eyes! ...A cute one."
"Hey everyone! We are Zoe, and we are gonna hack them!"
"Time to hack the system!"
"Ooh! Rebooting inside the system!"
"We're gonna space tangle the encrypt override with a chaos cypher metakey and spacio-code! Those aren't real words."
"Are you from here? I walk between worlds. Well, hop, actually. You're cuuuute..."
"If you won't pay attention to me, I'll blow up your world! Probably not... but I might!"
"I'm just saying, if you wanted to hold hands, that would be okay."
"I have a question I wanna ask, buuuuut I need you to say yes before I ask it."
"You don't own rainbows!"
"Double rainbows are dumb. You're dumb."
"Ahh... I need a nap."
"What's with all the negative waves?"
"There is another reality inside all of us. Maybe not you though."
"You might emerge somewhere else in the sky, somewhen else in time. That would be better."
"Is this the best physical representation you can manifest? It completely lacks zazz!"
"Yeah? Well..." Zoe blows a raspberry.
"Was that... sharing?"
"Oh. Wow. That's like, totally off the mandala."
"Thanks for asking! I like butterflies, unicorns, and watching the end of finite realities!"
"Could we play a game pleeease?"
"Changed your mind about me yet?"
"At dusk, a new game begins."
"These interactions are pretty weird."
"Wanna learn to play bubble stars?"
"Tag, you're it! Hey, I said you're it!"
"I don't want to grow up. You can't make me."
"♪ Want to see something neat? ♪"
"Ha! Let's get vloopy! ...That's a word, right?"
"I've got a magic present for you! Here it comes!"
"C'mon! Try and catch me!"
"This is the precipice of a new reality!"
"We're having fun, right?"
"More sparkles, now!"
"♪ What's your name? ♪"
"I'm coming over to say "Hi!""
"You're so funny, acting like magic hurts!"
"Good attacking! It's my turn, right?"
"I can't help myself in doing mean things, sorry!"
"Oh, do you wanna do something, we should do something!"
"Delightful little world you have... I like it!"
"I don't mean to hurt you. I just do sometimes!"
"You won't play? I'll make you!"
"Oh, you silly bean!"
"So this the type of game you like?"
"I'm Zoe. What's your name?"
"Do something fun! The world might be ending... Or not!"
"Hey, what else is fun?"
"This is the game you wanna play?"
"Are you smiling yet?"
"Hi! My name is Zoe."
"Fine weather, isn't it?"
"Your lives are short, but I love sparkles..."
"This should be fun. Fun~!"
"Paradigm shift time!"
"Hey, whatcha doing?"
"Um, I'm a space dragon! And I'm the center of the universe!"
"Bad, bad space dragon! Bad!"
"You're so full of yourself!"
"I'm not saying Lux isn't a good girlfriend buuuttt... you could do better!"
"You just haven't realized how cool I am yet!"
"Do I like you or chocolate mooncake more?! So hard to decide!"
"Hey! I might like liiikkeee you!"
"Hello! Hi! Hey! Or... whatever..."
"I attack you! Because... uh, reasons!"
"I did not say I wanna kiss you... yet..."
"Do you even know he likes you!?"
"Ezreal is really dreamy!"
"I'm not attacking you! I'm expressing my displeasure!"
"You are my rival! Prepare to be destroyed!"
"Why won't you hang out with me?!"
"Oh! So pretty! I want you to be my friend! Pleeeaaaasee!"
"Let's like, do something together... Oh! Do you like mooncake?!"
"I have a gift for you!"
"Like you, I will try my best! Also, chocolate mooncake!"
"We are going to be best friends!"
"What's wrong with liking pink?"
"I like your hair and clothes, so pretty!"
"I'm girly too. I'm a girl, aren't I?"
"You need more stardust, I could give you some!"
"I'm just cute. You're gorgeous!"
"Can I tell you a secret? I like you!"
"Do you wanna be sisters?"
"You're so cool! I love you!"
"This is fun, right?"
"It's so random, becoming best friends.."
"Do you have a boyfriend? Tell me! I must know!"
"Oh so cute! So so cute!"
"Oh you're precious. I could eat you up!"
"You're supposed to be happy fuzzy."
"What a wittle wovewy thing you are!"
"You're. So. Fluffy!"
"I just want to hug you 'til you explode!"
"Run you fluffy cutie thing!"
"Are you made of rainbows? So cute!"
"You're ugly, but in a cute way."
"They were like, 'AHHH! Foosh.'"
"How did I?! Uuuughh!"
"Am I the only one who can see these?"
"Should I have picked this one up?"
"These beings just leave magic everywhere!"
"Never enough pockets for these spells."
"Guess I'll keep it."
"Aw, this spell is neat!"
"You left a copy of your spell here. I took it. Kthx."
"We all grow up! Well, you died, but... y'know."
"Gotcha! Now that was more sparkles."
"Wait... they aren't coming back?"
"Goodbye, my new friend!"
"THAT WAS AWESOME-AWESOME! Right?"
"BYE BYE! But isn't it better with sparkles and more colors?"
"Sorry! Beauty always has tears. Even when we're happy."
"Hehe! More chocolate mooncake for me!"
"You. Were. A poophead!"
"Another dead noob..."
"Aww, guess they were new to PvP."
"We are surrounded by noobs."
"Next time, can you be a challenge?"
"Aww, space dragon should have gotten back on his leash."
"I'm gonna miss that cosmic dragon... Oh look, butterflies!"
"Said he made all the stars, and the humans believed him?!"
"Cosmic space dragon? Kinda chatty. So arrogant."
"I liked your stars, but you're not the big deal you thought you were."
"What? No! Why isn't he moving anymore?"
"Oh no, I think I played too rough!"
"But now how is he gonna be my first kiss? He's dead!"
"He was so cute. I mean, uh, not that I noticed. Hehe."
"You probably didn't deserve that, Lux. Sorry, but not really."
"Oops, I might have gotten a little jealous. Sorry, Lux."
"I do not like yellow hair. And Demacia. And light magic. And everything about her!"
"'Oh, I'm Lux. I'm so tall, and all the boys like me!' HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM, 'SPARKLES'?!"
"Ah?-" Zoe makes blowing noises. "Wee-oo!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
