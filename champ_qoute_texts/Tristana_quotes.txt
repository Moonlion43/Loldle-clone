"Once a Bandle gunner, always a Bandle gunner!"
"Let me get in there!"
"I bravely volunteer to charge in recklessly!"
"Locked, loaded, and ready to rocket!"
"Let's get this party started!"
"Where's the action?"
"Bring on the bad guys!"
"Who wears a helmet?"
"Get in my way! I dare ya."
"I dare ya to dare me."
"You don't hurt 'em if you don't hit 'em."
"Sometimes outnumbered; never outgunned."
"Let me get in there!"
"Winners don't duck."
"I just need a point in the right direction."
"I might just drop in."
"A Bandle Gunner never turns tailâ€”unless it's to taunt you."
"Maybe we should shoot faster."
"Orders are more like guidelines, really."
"Wanna see the fireworks?"
"If it's worth shooting once, it's probably worth shooting a lot!"
"Anyone ever tell you you're a little clingy?"
"Is that gun full-sized?"
"You're not the only Yordle who knows how to fly, Corki."
"Try to keep up, old-timer."
"Hey, specs. What's cooking?"
"When you find the right gun, you only need one."
"Nice suit, Rumble! What d'you call it?"
"Eyes on the enemy, Rumble."
"Um, Teemo, are these mushrooms your rations or your ammo?"
"Oh, Veigar! Tell me all about your diabolical plan."
"Aw, Veigar!" Tristana smacks her lips. "You're cute when you're angry."
"Watch where you're exploding, Ziggs!"
"You make it easy to be unimpressed."
"You think you can outshoot me?"
"Is that a rocket in your pocket?"
"Please allow my cannon and I to conflict-resolve."
"A cannonball is the best icebreaker!"
"ðŸŽµ Let 'em come by land, by sea or air! Send 'em running home when the Bandle Gunners blare! ðŸŽµ"
"ðŸŽµ One stump high and ten stumps tall! Bandle Gunners show 'em all! ðŸŽµ"
"ðŸŽµ Bandle Gunners, what'd you see? Sir, just smoke and victory! ðŸŽµ"
"Things are heating up!"
"War stories don't write themselves."
"Last one in's on latrine duty!"
"Let's get in range."
"Here comes the boom!"
"Nothing a little gunpowder won't fix!"
"They joined the wrong army."
"Check the kick on this sucker!"
"Who wants some? You want some? Come on!"
"More where that came from."
"Just passin' through!"
"Didn't see that coming, did ya?"
"Thanks for breaking my fall!"
"Ahaha, you're in trouble now."
"Pilot to bombardier!"
"Over there, buster!"
"Point blank is the only blank I like!"
"Dropping like flies!"
"Hey, where'd ya go?"
"Hmph. Cannon fodder!"
"Target freaking annihilated!"
"Nothing like overkill!"
"Now you see 'em, now you don't."
"Can't wait to tell the recruits about that one."
"Any landing you can walk away from..."
"I should really start thinking about plan B's..."
"Maybe I cut that a little close... Maybe."
"I was never worried!"
"You should try fanning out!"
"Thanks for clumping!"
"How's that for a Bandle City beatdown?"
"You're gonna need a bigger castle."
"Bringing down the house!"
"Oh, that looks cool!"
"Is this blastproof?"
"Let's see if this makes it through the first explosion."
"Can't wait to try this out!"
"Ooh, I like the look of this baby!"
"I'm gonna need the extended warranty..."
"Does this make me royalty?"
"Sweet! Kinda gross, but sweet!"
"It can keep the bloodâ€”I'm thirsty for action."
"All the risk and none of the consequences? I'm sold!"
"Time to live dangerously."
"Some people like backup plans. I like 'charge in' plans!"
"Infinity anything is pretty awesome!"
"If there's a sword for making things explode, this is it."
"It won't be so much a whisper as a deafening explosion!"
"Cannons versus armor; cannons win."
"I don't take cover. I take cover-out."
"No slowing me down now!"
"Perfect for cutting loose."
"Nets, snares, vines: meet your worst nightmare."
"Time to fill up my dance card!"
"Watchin' our backs."
"Time for some rearm and redeploy!"
"Gotta get back out there!"
"Back to the action!"
"Ready for some fireworks?"
"Well, I had a blast!"
