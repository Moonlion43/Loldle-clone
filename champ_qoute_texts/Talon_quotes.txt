"Live and die by the blade."
"They won't survive."
"Only fools pledge life to honor."
"On the razor's edge."
"I never compromise."
"There's nowhere to hide."
"Your allegiances mean nothing to me."
"Let's finish this quickly."
"Eventually, my blades will find their way into your heart."
"Have you anything to offer but weakness?"
"Ugh, I lost another blade. I wonder who it's in this time."
"The worst part of losing a blade is trying to trace back all my stabbings."
"This blade's my favorite."
"Enjoy the taste of steel."
"Their bones will whet my blade."
"Another body for the gutter."
"This is no challenge."
