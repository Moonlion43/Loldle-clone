"You know you want me."
"Once again, a woman's left unsatisfied."
"This place is so bland. It needs a splash of red."
"Let's see... whose life shall I ruin today?"
"Oooh, so many joyful people to hurt."
"Show me the man who has everything, and I'll show you my next victim."
"Suffering is the meaning of life. Well... their lives."
"This craving will soon be sated."
"Girls just wanna tear your throat out with their teeth."
"Drink the pain, toss away the rest."
"I feel their looks like hot breath. They feel my claws like hot knives."
"Need to find me? Just follow the trail of widows."
"All my exes are dead."
"Every smile is just a frown waiting to be turned upside down."
"I hurt them 'til they hurt no more."
"I like the happy ones. They have so much farther to fall."
"Misery loves whatever I tell it to."
"Hate and love are just two words for passion."
"I can't feel anything... until they do."
"I don't break hearts. I just tear them from rib cages."
"♪ Rend their flesh, flay them head to toe. ♪"
"Through suffering they come to love me. Every. Single. One."
"Keep them longing, make them plead."
"Once I was overwhelmed by the agony. Now I can't get enough."
"Let's see... something to fill the emptiness..."
"Just looking for that special someone to torment."
"I remember when just a little pain did the trick."
"You really don't know someone 'til you've seen them beg for mercy."
"Someday they'll love me for who I really am."
"One touch, with desire... that's all I need."
"The height of their happiness is the depth of their pain."
"My love cuts to the quick."
"Their mouths say no, but their bodies say "flay me alive.""
"They're all my favorites... until they break."
"I only do one night stands."
"A man once told me to put on some clothes. So I wore his skin."
"Human. Agony. My two favorite words."
"I use every part of their torment. Nothing is wasted."
"These curves are real."
"Without pain, how would they know pleasure?"
"Hate? No! I hurt them out of love."
"Don't try to tell me I'm not gorgeous."
"Always dress like you're seducing your next victim."
"Every kill is just a lover who didn't work out."
"People have too many emotions. What am I supposed to do with "empathy"?"
"They love to watch me leave."
"Who does a girl have to kill to start another Rune War?"
"I tasted peace once. Didn't do it for me."
"That skin looks good on you, but it would look better on my bedroom floor."
"First time being tortured? Don't worry, I'll do everything."
"I've had my eye on you. *giggles* Now I'm gonna rip yours out."
"I'll suck every last drop of joy from your heart." *giggles*
"I don't really have friends. Just people I haven't eviscerated yet."
"Ugh, I wouldn't torture you if you were the last person on earth."
"What's the point of torturing you?"
"With infinite power comes an infinite capacity for pain."
"I can make you do a lot more than jingle, space man."
"So, you're a masochist? What'cha doing later?"
"Can your kind even feel? I don't want to waste my time."
"Blindfolds, huh? Whatever does it for ya."
"I've seen your wife. You can do better."
"You seem happy. Let's fix that."
"Why don't we leave the lights on for this?"
"I like your style, Kench, but stay out of my territory."
"So how are you, River King? I see you haven't missed a meal."
"Ooh, I love watching you work."
"How do you kill them so slowly? You have to teach me."
"Don't worry, love. You'll join them soon."
"Just the way I like 'em. Big and stupid."
"You look like someone I could hurt for days."
"Naughty, naughty. That gets you a lashing."
"Know what else is funny? Pulling your tongue out through your neck."
"Love at first sight... And last."
"Scream. It makes it better."
"Nothing personal, I just need you to suffer horribly."
"Don't die wishing you'd had this."
"Sealed with a kiss."
"Wanna get outta here?"
"I can't wait to see your pain face."
"Come on, let's see those tears."
"Ohh, yes... Cry for me, honey."
"Ooh, you're so hot when you're hurt."
"Let's find your spot, love."
"We're done when I'm done."
"The more I cut away, the closer we'll get."
"My pleasure, your pain."
"Let me see you hurt."
"Everyone's pain tastes different. What flavor is yours?"
"Shut up and scream."
"Like what you see? I'll rip off your eyelids!"
"I know you're hurting, but I can't feel without this."
"Careful. I'm a biter."
"They're just so... stabbable!"
"Hope you like it rough."
"Your fear is delightful."
"Awww, you thought you were getting lucky!"
"Don't worry, honey, I'm open to all types."
"What a magnificent creature... Let's kill it slowly!"
"Cold blooded. Just like me."
"Not the first time I've had dragon."
"My... that's a lot of pain."
"The bigger they are, the more places you can hurt them."
"You're a lot to love."
"Finally! A man who can satisfy me."
"They all look the same in the dark."
"Let's play hard to get."
"The night is my veil."
"What they don't know won't hurt them... yet."
"Oooh, I like to watch."
"Let's sneak around."
"The things we whisper in the dark."
"They can touch, but they can't look."
"It's better in the dark."
"Let Evelynn take over."
"That's it, love. Let your guard down."
"The things I'm going to do to you."
"Ooh, are you lonely? I can help."
"A little bit of heaven, before the hell."
"Wait for me, sweetie."
"Stay right there, love."
"No, no! Don't die yet!"
"Aw, playtime's over."
"Was it as good for you as it was for me? No? Too bad!"
"Look at me! I need to watch you go."
"Ugh... I think we should break up."
"Ugh... I thought you'd last longer."
"Once again, a woman's left unsatisfied."
"We need to talk. I want to kill other people."
"It's okay, hun, happens to everyone."
"Oh well... Time to find a new toy."
"Why not give them something to take off?"
"I prefer going naked but... okay."
"It's a sin to cover something so perfect."
"I do like your style, Liandry, whoever you were."
"Aahh, still wet with the tears of Liandry herself."
"Now, they will all know true pain."
"Even a lich can suffer."
"This land will become a sea of torment."
"Hello, hat. Ready to feast on the pain of others?"
"Think of all the places this can go."
"Imagine what we can do with this."
"Be right back. Gotta put my face on."
"Always leave them wanting more."
"Mind if I slip into something a little more... painful?"
"A girl's gotta know when to disappear."
"Love 'em and leave 'em."
"One last... kiss..."
"I thought... we had something..."
"So this... is... pain?"
"So, they like it rough."
"Guess who's back for more?~"
"Ugh, dying is such a turn-off."
