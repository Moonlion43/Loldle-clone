"'Kay. See if I care."
"'Kay. See if I care."
"And then I told her, 'Get outta my room!' And she said, 'This is my house, young lady and'... Oh, hang on, Shadow. I'll finish this later."
"Blegh, just got here: already over it."
"Other people are here? Ugggh, great."
"This is going to be... awful, in a very good way. A good, awful way. You know what I mean!"
"Hmm. What color should I wear today? Black? Or charcoal?"
"Before I met the Black Mist, I lived in a world of color and happiness. I was so lost."
"Welcome to Sad Town. Population: Me. Everyone else get out."
"Let's turn these smiles upside down."
"Ugh, can we get some rain clouds in here."
"D'ughhh, look at that tree. So stupid."
"Uggh... more of the same."
"Yep. The glass is half empty."
"It's not a phase and I won't grow out of it!"
"I can feel it. Someone's happy over there."
"Think sad thoughts. Think sad thoughts."
"I'll show them the meaning of apathy. Or not."
"I'm only in this place cause I hate it."
"Okay... time to take it down a level."
"Ugghh, Shadowwww, carry meeee."
"Yeah. I wore this yesterday. What about it?"
"I could really use less friends."
"Every silver lining has a dark cloud."
"Man... walking suucks."
"This place is so getting harrowed."
"If I can't be happy, no one can."
"Calm down, Shadow. I'm trying to sulk."
"I'm coming, I'm coming."
"Death is the true meaning of life. Whoa! That's deep."
"Wish my hood covered all my face."
"Uggh, this place has way too many colors."
"Stop copying me, Shadow."
"Guess I'll mope over here."
"You know what, Shadow? Sometimes... I almost don't hate you."
"This is as far as my eyes can roll."
"Ugghhh, this is gonna take foreverrr. Why is everything so far?"
"Okay, Shadow. Wake me when we hit something."
"I could start a club for people who hate people! Ehh, but no one would show up."
"I am not cute. I am dark and forlorn and hopelessly morbid!"
"Why do I even wake up in the morning? Oh, right. To make people miserable."
"I wouldn't say I ran away from home. More like... trudged. Yeeeah, trudged."
"Shadow, I think I'm gonna start calling you... 'Scar'."
"It is not a stupid name. 'Shadow' is a stupid name."
"So you're the reason I have to be here today?"
"Let's make this easy. I'll wait here and you go die."
"Just give up. I did."
"We're all doomed, but you're more doomed."
"Another person to kill. Shadow, can you handle it?"
"Life sucks... but at least I'm not you."
"You'd like Bandle City. It sucks too."
"You're sad and dead? We should hang out."
"No doctors. I already told you, being sad makes me happy."
"Ah, you had me at death lost me at singing."
"Two guns? Could you try any harder?"
"Oh, no. Happiness and rainbows? I'm gonna barf twice."
"Saw you're human now, Thresh. Never thought you'd be the one to go normie."
"Hey, Veigar? You're at a ten. I need you to take it down to like... a two."
"You know what, Viego? I liked your earlier stuff better."
"I don't have to listen to you, Viego. You're not my real dad."
"Ugh, Yasuo... I can already tell we are not gonna vibe."
"I'm not really a cat person. I'm more of a... nothing person."
"'Oh, look at me. I'm a sentinel saving the world from darkness.'"
"'Sup, ghost. We hanging later? Cool."
"Just keep walkin', yordle. I got nothin' to say to you."
"Honestly, you taunt yourself just by being you."
"Don't care. Don't care. Don't care."
"Ahh, Viego... is okay. I mean, he's whatever... I guess."
"Don't care. Don't care. Don't care."
"I'm danciiiiing. Happy?"
"Ugh, do we have to?"
"Die... or something."
"You don't understand me!"
"So what're we doin'?"
"That's close enough."
"You should frown more."
"D'ugh! Personal space, people!"
"Bring it down a notch."
"Don't even think about it."
"I wouldn't do that."
"Do the thing, Shadow."
"Awesome! I-I mean... Pfft whatever."
"Well, that happened."
"One less person to deal with."
"Way to die, normie."
"You're lucky. Being a ghost is so cool."
"You look better this way."
"That's whatcha get for tryin'."
"Shadow, can I get, like five minutes alone? 'Kay, fine."
"I am so over this place."
"Oh. Where are we goin'? Y'know what? It doesn't matter."
"Finally... the part were I get to leave."
"If anyone needs me I'll be back... uhh, I-I dunno. Whenever."
"Darkness, take me. Seriously. I'm burning up out here."
"Time to get up already?"
"No, leave me alone. I'm sleeping..."
"Please... put me back in my misery...!"
"That... wasn't as cool as I thought it'd be."
"Well that was some quality alone time."
"Okay, I'm awake... Stop already!"
"I get to do it all again? Yaaay."
"Oh, Shadow, just leave me."
