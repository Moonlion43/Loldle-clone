"So many weapons, Aphelios. The deadliest is your faith."
"Condemned to darkness, where our power grows."
"With every step, two steps. With every breath, two breaths."
"Even from across the celestial veil… I will be with you, brother."
"It always starts with pain. We can only do this together, Aphelios."
"Your life upon the altar, brother… I will not betray it."
"Aphelios… I hear you. I know what you sacrifice."
"Will they still call you 'fiend' when they die, looking in your eyes? Or will they see the savior I see, Aphelios?"
"Order fights for light. Chaos fights for darkness. In the moon, we have found both: a way to survive."
"We are meant to hate each other. But we will show them all, wicked and divine, that we are stronger together."
"Find your orbit, brother."
"Again and again, I see you reach… for me."
"I am with you… shining above."
"I beseech the moon to protect you."
"Darkness is not heresy. It lies within us all."
"We cannot let fear trap us in twilight."
"Through your eyes, I see such wonders…"
"When your steps falter, brother, follow my voice."
"You knew this would not be easy, the way forward written in scars."
"By my word, you walk into the night."
"Our destiny is hidden in the night."
"How can I help you when I put your life at risk?"
"I am right. This is what the moon tells me."
"You are the weapon the Lunari need."
"All we ask is for a witness to our sorrow."
"Even when I close my eyes… I'll never look away."
"Remember what you have learned, brother."
"I'm never further than a whisper echoing in silence."
"Beneath the mask of silence… I know your true face, brother."
"Do not look back, Aphelios."
"We're in this together. Darkness and light."
"The moon shines brightest in darkness."
"From our fortress, I will guide you. I promise."
"As light reveals our path, so will darkness."
"Each of us, an offering."
"We must find each other before every first light."
"I am your sister. I am listening."
"Walk where I cannot."
"The brighter my light, the stronger your shadow."
"You walk the path of darkness, but you do not walk it alone, brother."
"You are not alone. Remember our promise."
"The dawn will know the night's silence."
"We walk through violence. Born of shadow. Born of light."
"The pain makes you numb. But I can still feel, brother. I know the truth that pain hides."
"You cannot feel the tear running down your cheek. I cannot wipe it away…"
"Phel… You have made every movement a thousand times. Until you bleed. Until you do not have to think."
"We cannot touch the moon. But its light can touch us. Shouldn't that be enough? Light, on our fingers…"
"The Solari call us heretics, but when darkness comes, brother, they will need our light."
"Our path is set between the last breaths taken by our enemies."
"What we want, what we need, what we must do… I envy the ignorant."
"The fortress is quiet. If only you could be here, Phel. You would make this stone seem loud."
"Without pain, we would not need faith. The moon would not need us. We would not need each other, Aphelios."
"Our thoughts touch… impossibly close. Which of us am I?"
"I see further through the celestial veil. What we call truth is shadow."
"You make yourself a weapon, so you do not have to feel. But you are not a weapon; you are my brother."
"You will make death more than death, brother. You will make it holy."
"If pain is what awaits us in the darkness, brother… we must run to it, unafraid."
"It is as the moon revealed, Aphelios. As beautiful. As terrifying."
"Even when the moon is new, it is there. A whisper to the shadows of your soul… I am with you."
"The fortress looms around me. It is everything. It is the only thing."
"We have no enemies, Aphelios. Only those fated to meet us in the night."
"Our faith will be tested."
"The aspect of the moon. What is she fleeing? What has she done?"
"Our aspect has returned… bringing darkness."
"Diana knows the moon's name, Aphelios. I can feel it on her heart."
"We were born to twin destinies, to tragedy, as the sisters were before us."
"Senna, in darkness, we find each other."
"Soraka knows our pain, yet tells us not to feel it. To deny ourselves."
"Yuumi is much friendlier when she visits me in the spirit realm, snuggling at my feet while I read Book and imagine the rain."
"What do they hold if they only reach for the trigger?"
"The greatest power is the power greater than ourselves."
"To become a vessel for the heavens, one only needs faith."
"The moon is with us in darkness, but it is not there for us."
"The Solari do not see: we shine brightest with another's light."
"Stone and spirit return to you."
"The power of your belief."
"For every phase, a weapon."
"Soul and skill converge."
"Through sacrifice, all things."
"By light, the moon speaks!"
"A reckoning in stone."
"Weapons aimed by destiny."
"You have bled, so they will."
"Every movement, a ceremony."
"It ends in silence."
"Until night is everything."
"They orbit their end."
"You are the moon's eclipse."
"No thought moves your hand."
"This will be your voice."
"Your fight echoes even here."
"In your hand. From my heart."
"Blessings of the moon."
"An omen in your grasp."
"Carry the faith with you."
"Reach out, Aphelios."
"The full moon reveals."
"I will extend your reach, brother."
"Moonlight will guide your aim."
"Harvest death for life."
"The moon gathers darkness on the crescent's edge."
"With every slash, resurrection."
"A new moon. The same darkness."
"They will not escape what is coming."
"Darkness will weigh upon them."
"Their steps will falter in darkness."
"Cosmic flame will fill the night."
"The moon grows in flame."
"Enlighten the many."
"Death, arcing from your hand."
"An orbit of blades."
"The half moon, perfectly balanced."
"They are motes of dust, shimmering in moonlight."
"A prayer for their souls. Torn from the night."
"When you shine, the moon can worship. You did well, Aphelios."
"To make a life of death… you do what you have to, brother."
"Not even she knew what she would do. That was why she was afraid."
"The heavens turn toward darkness. Now is our time."
"Mother moon, guide them."
"Only one of us is safe."
"We bleed when we cannot cry."
"Blood upon still lips."
"You will not suffer in silence."
"Out of darkness, the moon is born anew."
"I will not let you die."
"As darkness falls, the moon rises."
