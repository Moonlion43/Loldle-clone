"What masterpiece shall we play today?"
"Haha. I can never shake the nerves before a big performance."
"I never could refuse an empty stage. Not even this one."
"Curtains up. I'm ready."
"A wrong note is just...a happy little accident."
"Hear and feel everything"
"I find inspiration in every smile and every tear."
"The joy of an audience is always worth it."
"Life is a beautiful ballad."
"Hmm, which arrangement suits the mood?"
"Emotion, love, those are the real instruments!"
"The symphony never ends."
"Art is something everyone can share."
"The tempo changes and so do we."
"My music is my voice."
"Stir the music of the heart."
"I'll play any stage once. Some, just the once."
"A melody to guide us home."
"King or commoner, everyone loves a show."
"The right song can soothe the soul of a nation."
"Never be afraid to listen."
"The rhythm connects us all."
"Practice makes perfect."
"A true masterpiece should celebrate living."
"The world is cruel. Until that changes, I'll never stop playing."
"Magic is like a song. It's woven into everything. Waiting."
"This is no ordinary instrument. More like an old friend."
"My music warms old souls and soothes hardened hearts. It is my greatest joy."
"Mastery is the first step. The rest is what you do with it."
"Art bridges the gaps between people. Governments, not so much."
"Strings move, and people dance in time with the memories."
"Demacia is my home, but I will never forget Ionia."
"Am I supposed to know this person? Is he a... fan?"
"Fiddlesticks? But the songs, they can't be real."
"Is that Irelia? I haven't seen her since the restoration."
"Why won't Jarvan act? All it would take is a single decree."
"A Crownguard and a mage? Wouldn't want to be her."
"And where has Ryze been? Hunting for more world ending relics?"
"Oh. Is the grand general a fan?"
"Sylas? He hasn't changed. And my answer is still no."
"It's good to see Taric hasn't changed. And bad. It's both."
"There's so much pain in Xin Zhao's heart. Why?"
"Huh. Sounds like a personal problem."
"Just keep smiling and... Maybe they'll go away."
"An aggressive movement!"
"A symphony of justice."
"Keep your voice down!"
"With perfect tempo."
"You've struck a bad chord."
"Order through music."
"Someone's feeling it."
"Two hearts in three-four time."
"Don't make me get off stage."
"I'll help you find your seat."
"We've got a heckler."
"I'm not looking for notes."
"The fanfare ascends."
"Everything in harmony."
"Accelerated movement."
"Ugh. That wasn't part of the show."
"Oh, they'll be fine."
"Just an intermission I hope."
"Everyone's a critic."
"When fields lie calm, and wind stands still. Run home."
"Sorry Garen, but I can't help if I'm locked up."
"I don't think Ionia will be rushing to invite me back."
"A single decree and he just wouldn't do it."
"Did he want four autographs? I don't understand."
"Don't worry Lux. One day, our kind will be free."
"Those artifacts can't really end the world Ryze, right?"
"Good. Mages have enough problems without you Sylas."
"Get up Taric. You're chewing the scenery."
"We're both a long way from home Xin Zhao. Rest easy."
"Accurate like a metronome."
"Every note is important."
"Keep and eye out for music snobs."
"Just setting up before the next song."
"It's like a little usher." Sona giggles."
"You look out for me and I'll look out for you."
"Remember to wait for your cue." Sona giggles."
"Oops. Lost myself for a minute."
"A surprise encore? If they insist."
"Once more with feeling."
