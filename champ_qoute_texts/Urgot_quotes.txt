"You cannot know strength... Until you are broken."
"Cling to hope... It is all you have."
"Enjoy this final moment... before your trial begins."
"Controlling them will be simple... with my hand around their throats."
"It is time... for them to die."
"If they could only comprehend the truth of the Dredge... I wouldn't need to drive it into their skulls."
"I detect the presence of scum."
"The machine is ready."
"We will rise from the rubble, stronger than before."
"Few will endure the chaos to come."
"I want to see their faces when I tear their hope away."
"Endless misery, mhm... Wonderful."
"Their cries are calling me home."
"Cast into a pit of despair, I climbed out on the corpses."
"Power. Fear. These are my weapons."
"I will guide you to a new age, born of destruction."
"Think how much stronger they'll be... if they live."
"Tear their weakness away, and nothing is left!"
"Your fear, given chemtech and flesh."
"Their future is carved into my flesh."
"Only those who survive this city deserve it."
"If you hide in the shadows, you are only drawing me home."
"This is the only truth that matters: a weapon aimed at your head."
"Strength... will be tested."
"Where will they run when the whole city burns?"
"There is no coming back."
"Who among you are worthy?"
"I answer to no one. No matter how loudly they beg."
"I am the very definition of a self-made man."
"I was not reborn in the depths. I merely refused to die."
"I am stronger than man, stronger than machine, I am an idea."
"If they do not stop me, they will die. It is just that simple."
"Screams follow in my wake."
"A new order... chaos."
"A city, choking in the Chem-barons' grasp."
"The weak are condemned."
"Zaun will be redeemed... in the flames."
"Carnage—as intoxicating as chemtech."
"Such marvels, built of pain."
"Do you think me so weak as to fall for your charms?"
"My, my. What have they been up to in Piltover?"
"I must admit, I have a thing for... legs."
"The hand of Noxus can be cut off; ask your  master."
"My replacement? Really, now?"
"This one... has potential."
"The child is learning."
"If you feed on pain, I welcome you to the feast."
"Give me a reason to fear you."
"You defeated Noxus. For that, I will make this quick."
"I heard you like to give hugs."
"The city calls for chaos. She is but the first to answer."
"I hope your father begged when Swain betrayed him."
"Where do your loyalties lie? I will bury you next to them."
"This is not your land, and that lizard doesn't even like you."
"Let the rage carry you... into my chains."
"You respect strength. Good. Then you understand."
"Noxus failed you... when it did not punish your betrayal!"
"Caught between two worlds? I'll drag you out of both."
"You've felt my pain. Now feel yours."
"I will not kneel to a deceiver."
"Your coat isn't even as nice as mine."
"Compared to what you do, this is merciful."
"How brave of you to volunteer."
"Don't be greedy, there's enough pain for all of us."
"Beneath those gloves... you are broken."
"The only thing you enforce is limitations."
"You can die beside them, but you will never be a Demacian."
"You were made to be a weapon. Embrace it."
"This... is going to be messy."
"Piltover is a parasite."
"There is always another trial."
"Think of all that you have survived."
"Zaun welcomed me with open arms... and a knife to my back."
"Pain is the act of becoming."
"What is strength if you do not use it?"
"It is not violence. It is... philosophy."
"No, please, tell me about your religion."
"That is what I want you to think."
"Death. Could not. Break me."
"Urgot, hm, I highly recommend death at this point."
"But I still have so much to kill for."
"I am Zaun's reckoning!"
"Hahaha... Is that crying I hear? Or are you mewling?"
"Your cries will give voice to chaos."
"Life favors the strong."
"Death will end your agony."
"You will know fear."
"Pain will not betray you."
"You will fall so far."
"I will lay your weakness bare."
"Do not fight it. Shh..."
"Chaos will set you free."
"All must be tested."
"The barons are not your masters—fear is."
"This pain is a gift."
"You listen to my words, while my weapons speak!"
"I am not your enemy."
"Feel this. The pain will prove useful later."
"Zaun, bear witness."
"Break men to break their shackles."
"The fortunate will be the first to fall."
"Existence is torment."
"What didn't kill me, will kill you!"
"You have already lost."
"A crucible of pain!"
"You cannot rule what I have turned to ash!"
"The suffering is only beginning."
"Another slave to pain."
"I offer redemption."
"What will you do to survive? TELL ME!"
"They put me in chains. They gave me my weapon."
"Cut their weakness out!"
"Accept what you have always known."
"Keep struggling. Maybe you can save your hat."
"Scream louder, I want Swain to hear it!"
"A duel to your death."
"Think of all the innocent barrels I'm saving."
"Let me introduce you to death."
"Tranquility awaits."
" She'll never escape, and neither will you."
"Metal... meet metal."
"Here, kitty, kitty..."
"Your rage makes you... predictable."
"Bringing the beast to heel."
"You only have yourself to blame."
"If only you were stronger."
"The weak deserve to die!"
"No one will shed a tear. That is why you cry."
"What kind of monster would kill a child? Oh... right."
"Stars fall the hardest."
"Say 'Shurima' one more time!"
"Those who stand behind you will share your fate."
"I considered you my equal. I was wrong."
"Noxus already had an executioner."
"Your friends are the chain you could not break."
"Frankly, I never found you attractive."
"You belong in a grave."
"Slippery, aren't you?"
"Hmph. I thought you would be bigger."
"I don't know what he said, but he screamed it."
"Of all the people to fail a test."
"Make way for Jarvan the Fifth!"
"You chose... the wrong weapon."
"And Piltover rejoices."
"I never saw the beauty in death... until now."
"A father should be with his  daughter."
"The storm... breaks."
"That thing spit in my eye."
"Every one of you, as dead as the last."
"Let me know how it tastes."
"I had my fill of stones in the Dredge."
"You finally live up to your name."
"Power must be earned."
"Friends to the end, how inspiring."
"As the bones foretold: a quiet, peaceful death!"
"You died the moment you let a god control you."
"You were the hero. Now you're dead."
"I'm sure Valor will swoop down any second..."
"A resplendent death; feathers and fur."
"Don't worry, I'll take care of those runes."
"Aw, Sion. You were already dead to me."
"No music. Only silence."
"You knew this day would come!"
"You've betrayed me for the last time!"
"You were never in control."
"Obedient to the end."
"You bargained away your freedom... for a frozen stick."
"I liked the old you more."
"Did you say bow, or bow?"
"Evil needs a new master."
"You could have been so much more."
"Evolution gives way to revolution."
"Blood in, blood out."
"Birds of a feather, die together."
"The world does not need gods."
"You'd think a nation of pirates would never bow."
"I am all the weapon I need."
"The walls come tumbling down."
"What'll be born of your suffering?"
"Balance gives way, to chaos."
"Every empire falls."
"Without Zaun, you are nothing!"
"I'll finish what the Mist started."
"The sands will bury you all."
"The stars are too far away to help you."
"In the depths, we are all animals."
"The Void may learn, but not quickly enough."
"We will make Zaun great again."
"Your strength has saved you."
"There are more trials to come."
"Sacrificed for the cause."
"One falls, as many rise."
"You admit your weakness."
"At last, you know your place."
"Raise them up on chains. Zaun will see my message."
"Now, to destroy everything you love."
"Zaun, let this be your warning."
"A pathetic display."
"Do not waste my time."
"Are none of you worthy?!"
"Do you feel... safer?"
"Strength comes from suffering."
"You only prolong your agony."
"Was the pain too much?"
"Did you think that would save you?"
"Come back when you are stronger."
"You try to flee, not realizing... you are in chains."
"Brutality. I approve."
"Gather your strength. Soon, I will take it."
"You die when I choose."
"Zaun calls for its headsman."
"Our rise cannot be stopped."
"Echoing from the depths."
