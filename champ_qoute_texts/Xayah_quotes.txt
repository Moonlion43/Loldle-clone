"I can never resist an invitation to dance."
"Fine, I'll just be over here... sharpening my feathers."
"Let's cut 'em to ribbons."
"Ah, silence, so golden. Like Rakan. Kind of miss him. Even if he is... noisy."
"The vastaya named the world. We named the trees, the wind, the mountains. We know their power."
"If love is feeling so deeply for another that you want to chew your way under their skin, then I love Rakan..."
"We pledged ourselves to each other in the middle of a tavern brawl. The whole place reeked of vomit, sweat and blood. It was so romantic!"
"They'll probably label me a war criminal one day, but not today."
"The world owes the Vastaya a great debt. I'm here to collect."
"I'm just an ordinary girl. An ordinary girl with an infinite supply of death quills."
"Alright, let's go! This way or that way?"
"We always have a plan."
"Ugh, I hate everyone today."
"I know what'll make you feel better..."
"Murdering everyone!"
"If things go wrong..."
"They always go wrong."
"They don't always go wrong."
"They mostly go wrong."
"That's why I'm here."
"Hey, I have a plan."
"You... have a plan?"
"Yeah! I'll go on instinct!"
"That's the opposite of a plan."
"You sure about this?"
"So, this mission... are we, uh...?"
"Are you pretending to be dumb?"
"Well, I mean... I don't have to remember the plan if you do."
"When are we going to do this?"
"Soon, baby. Slow down."
"Tavern brawls just seem to find me."
"Nature bends towards chaos. Give in, or break."
"Chaos is the preferred state of nature."
"Sometimes people die for a good cause – namely, mine. That's why I'm an optimist."
"I hate flowers. Tiny skulls stuffed with twigs, on the other hand..."
"Cloudy days are my favorite."
"Ionia used to be so nice... before humans tamed all that wild cataclysmic magic."
"Humans. They're so very blind."
"Spiders are my spirit animal."
"Once, magic was everywhere, or as the Vastaya say: om upo sa't."
"Ionia's meddling birthed our rebellion."
"I prefer to work at night, because, y'know, the sun? Bright? Yuck!"
"Pandemonium follows me everywhere I go. It's like a puppy I once fed..."
"Nature is wild and untamed, not balanced."
"Magic is not some river that can be easily channeled. It is a churning sea that goes where it pleases."
"If Rakan were here, I'd make out with him until his ears bled. He loves it when I do that."
"I really hate anyone who's not me... or Rakan."
"Ionians never learn."
"Talking to anybody about anything is never on my to-do list."
"No one will block my path."
"Rebellion puts the fire in my blood."
"We Vastaya are only half of our full glory."
"All women desire Rakan. Like they'd know what to do with him."
"They say I don't know when to quit. Like that's a weakness."
"I will rest when our homelands are restored."
"Our Vastayan essence fades with each passing day."
"Oh, I was born to ruffle feathers."
"Talking to people makes me want to stab them... so I do."
"If our existence is everyone else's chaos, so be it."
"Victors are the sole authors of history. Time to write our chapter."
"Compromise is so unsatisfying."
"Sabotage takes patience and time... and lots of feather daggers."
"I'll do whatever needs to be done... twice, just to be sure."
"Keep them distracted."
"That shouldn't be a problem."
"You're pushing yourself too hard."
"Where are we going?"
"You forgot the plan."
"No, I... yeah. Hey, have you seen this cape?"
"You remember the Aphae waterfall?"
"I'd like to go there again."
"Well, try not to die then."
"Pay attention to me."
"What the hell were you thinking?"
"I wasn't. I never think. Ugh... thinking."
"How can humans not hear the magic?"
"They're too busy building things."
"Because... they're afraid."
"Not saying 'I told you so.'"
"Okay, last time, it was totally my fault."
"You gonna marry me today?"
"Ask me again tomorrow."
"Do you love me because I'm beautiful, or because I'm sexy?"
"Another road, another horizon."
"It's gonna be okay."
"You know I love you."
"What we have is greater than some human word."
"Did you notice the sky?"
"Not as beautiful as you."
"Ugh, what's with the accent?"
"I'm... trying something new. Do you like it?"
"If you need me, whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?"
"No, that's not whistling."
"If you don't want to do this..."
"You're only here because of me."
"...nah. Freedom fighting is a good look for me."
"What are those things humans wear on their feet?"
"I need shoes. Red ones. I need them so bad."
"Did I tell you I love you?"
"Yes... but say it anyway."
"Why do you never say yes?"
"'cause then... I wouldn't get to hear you ask."
"Can we just stay here?"
"We must keep moving."
"Xayah? I think we got a problem..."
"I... know we got a problem?"
"You gotta rest, honey."
"Everyone is depending on me."
"What would you do if I died?"
"I would... burn this world to the ground and build a castle from the ashes, where I would live alone forever."
"Aw... that's sweet."
"I think scars are sexy."
"Okay. I'll get more."
"Wherever our hearts desire."
"How do you like me today?"
"More than yesterday, less than tomorrow."
"Do I make you happy, Rakan?"
"Every day of my life."
"I'm lucky to have you."
"No. I'm the lucky one."
"I swear, you will be the death of me."
"I'm fine with that."
"If we get separated, I'll find you."
"We won't get separated."
"You're already wandering off."
"No, I'm not! ... only a little."
"You are stunning and beautiful..."
"Why, thank you, darling."
"Yes. I was... definitely talking about you, honey."
"I need you to be more careful."
"If anybody's gonna die first, it's gonna be me. I can't see you die. Also, black is a terrible color on me."
"Baby, I don't do safe!"
"Oh, this is all so intense!"
"You can't tell me you weren't impressed!"
"Just generally! I'm amazing!"
"Honey, what are you doing?"
"I can't die looking this good!"
"After this, how about we get some human food?"
"We're eating chocolate!"
"Do you remember the plan?"
"Nope, but let's do it!"
"I have a cunning plan."
"Really? What is it?"
"I'm not going to tell you. That's the really cunning bit!"
"I think you intimidate human females."
"Should I show them the dance?"
"Show them the dance."
"You thinking about me?"
"That's very upsetting!"
"Baby, what did I tell you?"
"Did you see the clothes those guys were wearing?"
"I saw you. Everyone can see you."
"Yeah! That's what I like!"
"You want to start it off?"
"Let's start it off!"
"I'm a humble entertainer!"
"Yeah, I'm the best."
"Who is that gorgeous thing over there?"
"Now's not the time, darling."
"It's always the time!"
"Hey, I'm not gonna kill you, she is! Say hi, honey."
"I'm handling it, dear."
"How long do we fight?"
"Until we are free. Until magic is free."
"Is that after lunch?"
"Do you remember our escape route?"
"I'll take that as a no."
"How will we know if the plan works?"
"We'll still be alive!"
"Woo, shake those tail feathers, baby!"
"I am not a piece of meat."
"You used the secret call! Is everything alright?"
"We have a secret call? I just like that sound! Caw caw!"
"Hey, I need you here! Uh, never mind, just... go that way!"
"No one can control me!"
"That's right, babe."
"If I vanish, what would you do?"
"I would never be whole again."
"There's a surprise."
"Who can know these things?"
"You! You can know these things!"
"You want to be mortal? You are mu'takl."
"You betray your heritage, Ahri."
"Aw, poor sad little mummy! I just want to take you home."
"I don't want to hurt you, space dragon. We could be such good friends."
"I can't wait to burst your bubble."
"Who does your wardrobe? Fire them. Immediately."
"Wait, magic-powered sword legs? Is this a joke?"
"Is this another timeline where I beat you up again?"
"When I'm done with Ionia, I'll come for Demacia."
"Where can I get one of those delightful chthonic god-clutch purses? Does it come in purple? The god, not the bag."
"I want your happiness to evaporate."
"I want to travel the world with you."
"But is it really okay?"
"I don't want to spill Vastayan blood, Rengar."
"Your talking is not improving this wonderful silence."
"You're gross. Never change."
"You call that a rebellious nature?"
"You call that being a vampire?"
"We were not made to fight each other."
"Okay. Who invited the Yordle?"
"Yordles. Why did it have to be Yordles?"
"Yordles are the reason no one takes us Vastaya seriously."
"I can't even— I don't know where to begin."
"I will punch your soul in the face."
"Please, don't make me tryhard. I'm not in the mood."
"The next one to call me 'edgy' is getting choked to death."
"Can I just hate you to death?"
"I'm gonna murder you a thousand times."
"Am I supposed to be intimidated right now? I'm not sure what's going on."
"I'm about to ruin your day."
"Please, for the sake of us both, go far away."
"I ain't gonna kill you. She is!"
"Nice to unmeet you."
"Give them a pretty last image."
"You're not bad for someone who isn't Rakan."
"If we do this right, only one of us get shot."
"Get out there and take a bullet for me. Like a gentleman."
"Don't embarrass me."
"How am I supposed to work with— whatever this is?"
"Block the hits for me. Please?"
"Make me look good, and I'll make you look good, got it?"
"I'm insulted? I don't know."
"Ouch. I'm gonna need some aloe."
"I wasn't listening to what you said, but I sure am outraged."
"Watch your tongue... and your back."
"Say that to my feathers."
"I think we're supposed to laugh, now?"
"Smile and nod, honey."
"Hahaha... I don't know what that is."
"I'm not laughing. I needed to say that, just so you understand."
"Behold. I am depleted of cares."
"Next time, try using more hard 'k' sounds."
"Aw, yeah, let's get down!"
"Alright, put your back in to it!"
"All out of second chances. Sorry."
"My last nerve is long gone."
"A dance with me ends in blood."
"Move your feet, or lose some toes."
"A Vastayan feather is a kingly gift."
"When I dance, I lead."
"Compromise. It's a pain."
"They make chaos dance."
"Call me cute again."
"I always find a weak spot."
"Dance like your life depends on it."
"Hmm, what shall I cut off?"
"Baasi kommu yu-teha."
"Threading the needle."
"I leave nasty scars."
"Okay, so we're doing this."
"A thousand cuts is only the beginning."
"This is how I deal with unwanted attention."
"This was our world first."
"This is a preemptive 'No'."
"Listening. Such a simple concept."
"Yay, someone to throw knives at."
"I don't speak compromise."
"Quit crying! It's just a feather."
"It's only a little prick."
"Ever been stabbed by a feather?"
"My feathers are priceless."
"Violence is my favorite form of negotiation."
"Cut by a feather? So delicate."
"Are you having fun over there?"
"I can't hear you over all the fun I'm having!"
"The fight's here!, by me!"
"It's the same fight!"
"I hate everyone today!"
"Should we give them a fighting chance?"
"Only if we want to have fun."
"This reminds me of our first dates!"
"Mind if I cut in, Rakan?"
"Be my guest, miella!"
"I couldn't miss it!"
"Make them remember!"
"They'll never forget."
"Let's show 'em what we got."
"You love it when I slap fools?"
"This is the plan, right?"
"What do you want to do later?"
"I can think of something."
"Can we talk about this later?"
"But... but... food!"
"Eyes on the prize, baby."
"Rakan is very enthusiastic."
"I want to show 'em!"
"I adore your energy."
"Do we need any of these fools?"
"How long since we last danced?"
"These guys look silly!"
"How many fights we gotta win?"
"That was beautiful, baby!"
"Didn't see that coming?"
"I'm overcome with emotion."
"Anyone else want to try?"
"That was for the Vastaya."
"Well, they tried to stop me."
"I warned you. Oh, wait, did I? Crap. My fault."
"Alright, who's next?"
"Hmm, dodging seems to be a weak spot of yours."
"What? They were in my way."
"Few can keep up with me."
"Thanks for the dance."
"Got what they deserved."
"As far as obstacles go, that was about a... three out of ten?"
"And an F, for effort."
"Ah, it was nothing."
"Miella, I helped, right?"
"Couldn't have done it without you, mieli."
"Every time you do that, it drives me crazy."
"Well. I'll have to do it more often, then."
"Were... they trying?"
"Probably, but there are two of us."
"I love watching you kill."
"I love killing for you."
"Rakan, let's not gloat. Much."
"Did they deserve it?"
"Why do they break so easily?"
"They aren't made like us."
"That was a Vastayan farewell."
"Isn't a Vastayan farewell when you say, "ouulavaash?"
"I was trying to have a moment, Rakan."
"Did you see that? Haha! That was amazing!"
"They couldn't keep up with you."
"Only you can, Rakan."
"Too bad those tails weren't lives."
"Wasn't she just a ray of sunshine? I hate sunshine."
"And that's where plucky optimism gets you."
"We asked you to join."
"It needed to be done."
"This is by your design."
"Shame. You could have been so useful alive."
"Every drop of Vastayan blood spilled is a waste."
"The Vastaya will sing songs of you. I promise."
"Maybe I overdid it."
"I wasn't joking when I said nothing stands in my way."
"It's more of a slaughter than a massacre, really."
"A victory for the Vastaya."
"Hurray, they all died."
"I wish they could have seen the looks on their faces."
"I could dance right now. Aw, but there's more work to be done."
"Shoddy construction, through and through."
"Can you feel the magic flowing? I can."
"They should really get a refund from those masons."
"I've been known to implode a sacred obelisk or two."
"Another Vastayan victory."
"I will unblock the rivers of Vastayan essence."
"Sabotage looks so good on me."
"Untied that mystical knot."
"Another minor annoyance reduced to rubble."
"Magic is again unfettered."
"Each totem that falls strengthens the Vastayan cause."
"Hm, poor construction. No standards."
"Good henchmen are hard to find."
"That was too easy, but so much fun."
"Nothing is ever easy, but that was really easy."
"Don't feel bad, they're just magically animated sheets of cloth."
"They dropped something. Their guard."
"They mindlessly marched right to their deaths. Like everyone in Noxus."
"What the heck? I deserve it."
"This is overpriced, but I must have it."
"Hook me up with that magical creature discount?"
"Do I really need this? Ah... yes."
"Is this ethically sourced?"
"I want to buy all the things!"
"I know I'm being price gouged, but I'll splurge."
"Where did you get all these wonderful things?"
"But how much does it cost for me?"
"I am totally pulling this off."
"Rebellions thrive on intelligence."
"I never walk into a trap unprepared."
"See the enemy, know their mind."
"Sometimes, I have to watch my own back."
"I need a strategic viewpoint."
"Eyeball in the grass."
"Let's have a look-see, shall we?"
"I must know their every move."
"This is ambush territory."
"I hate surprises... unless I'm doing the surprising."
"Die, little inanimate spy."
"And they won't be needing that any more."
"Good thing I didn't do anything embarrassing."
"There's more than one way to blind an enemy."
"Found one! Killed it."
"Well, that's just an invasion of privacy."
"Aw, you're looking out for me!"
"Rakan, slap this fool for me!"
"Things are getting ugly."
"I can't do this alone."
"I'm going now. Where? Anywhere not here. That's where."
"Don't leave without me!"
"You going somewhere?"
"Oh, I wasn't finished with these fools yet."
"Oh, I wasn't finished with these fools yet."
"Death was nice and peaceful. Thanks for ruining it."
"Death was a nice vacation from the tedium, but nothing good can last, I suppose."
"I always wanted to be buried and resurrected in this outfit."
