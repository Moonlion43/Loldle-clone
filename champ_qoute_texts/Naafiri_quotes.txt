"We won't be muzzled."
"Let the world hear our howls and know that death awaits."
"One mind, spread among many vessels; this, is the way of the pack."
"The Darkin rise. Five sets of teeth in a ravenous maw."
"What chance will the world have, when the Darkin hunt as one?"
"Calloused by the burning sands of  Shurima. What can harm us, in this place?"
"It's not the strongest who survive—it's the most united."
"Why beg for scraps? Our meal is the entire feast!"
"A dune hound leaves nothing. Not even the bones!"
"The jaws of victory have many teeth!"
"You learn a lot with your nose to the ground."
"Sunborn, but pack raised."
"The faster they run, the sweeter the meat."
"Even Darkin need to eat."
"Let us expand our feeding grounds."
"Let's get some blood on our muzzles."
"The best defense is to bite first."
"There is no alpha, there is only the pack."
"The lone dog eats small game."
"Coordination, not chaos."
"It's lonely at the top of the food chain!"
"Even the strongest can be overwhelmed."
"Find their burrows! Ravage their warrens."
"We do not cower from a raised hand."
"Humans are petty—tear at their pride."
"The world is full of such savory little birds..."
"What game skitters by, unaware of death?"
"Unbroken, and unleashed!"
"One learns to step quickly across hot sand."
"Humans use more words, but say less."
"Together, we ascend once more."
"We've picked up a scent!"
"Nothing tastes better than the heels of fleeing prey!"
"One covers less ground on two legs."
"When the moment is right..."
"Ahhh, the stench of panic!"
"I could've led them. I could've dominated. But, there is no I... only we."
"Our kind had such a proving ground, once. All it proved was avarice."
"We never release our bite, even if the blood chokes us."
"Shurima gave me knowledge, the pack gave me wisdom."
"Ego is an illusion. A survival trick, for a feeble mind."
"We track for a thousand years. None can flee for that long."
"The tragedy of the kill is that it ends our chase."
"Find a hole, vermin... and hide yourself away."
"So, the trail of stench ends here. Hello, prey..."
"It does not bark. It is not brethren..."
"You're a long way from the den, pup...!"
"Shake it ragged, snap its neck!"
"Don't expect us to roll over and beg."
"Hear the gnashing of innumerable teeth!"
"What creature is fool enough to hunt in our domain?"
"We can hear your heart racing, little bird..."
"Stubborn Aatrox, so driven to die."
"Focus your rage, Aatrox. The pack needs you!"
"Rhaast, is that you? Love the new vessel!"
"Still struggling with your vessel, Rhaast? How unfortunate."
"You always were the reasonable one, Varus; so back away."
"Do not pity us Varus—we are now greater."
"Wretched yordle. What's the point of chasing something that doesn't try?!"
"A wolf with no pack? No wonder you howl!"
"We should thank you, Myisha. You showed us the way."
"How fast can you run, cat?"
"My, my—aren't you full of delicious bones?"
"It smells of the desert winds... It is Shuriman."
"Do not confuse feral, with stupid."
"Small things try to look big, don't they?"
"Who's a good dog? ...We are."
"I'm sorry; did you wish to smell my backside?"
"You are not the apex."
"Are you hurt, little bird?"
"Teeth in their throats!"
"Fight or flight, morsel!"
"We dared you to run!"
"The pack increases!"
"Welcome, fellow hound."
"More mouths, more bite."
"Wallow in their remains."
"Tastes like terror..."
"Kill its offspring, so we may thrive!"
"Death from a thousand bites!"
"Each gets a turn at the carcass!"
"At long last—enough bones for us all!"
"We hope you allow dogs... for your sake."
"Little something to... Whet our teeth!"
"Something to chew on, perhaps?"
"Move slowly, shopkeep. Wouldn't want to alarm us."
"Do not fear, shopkeep... We only kill things that flee!"
"The pack is grateful."
"Ahh yes, right behind the ears!"
"This is not slinking away, this is regrouping!"
"Let us rest elsewhere—never where we feed."
"This is not the feeding hour. Not just yet..."
"The knives pull us homeward; the pack abides."
"A good hound never forgets the way home."
"Tail... between... legs..."
"We smell... nothing..."
"Our hunger... fades."
"The chase... ends..."
"They think us beaten... But we've got their scent now."
"That was just... playing dead."
"No time to lick wounds—we must bite the hand that struck us!"
"They take us for a lapdog. Let us show them our teeth!"
"We stagger on, parched as the desert dunes."
"Famished. A meal would set us right..."
"That which cannot die, will in time devour all."
