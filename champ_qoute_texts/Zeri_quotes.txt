"A spark is all I need!"
"No spark between us anyway."
"You know what? We might die here. Let's make sure we go down swinging."
"Yell if you need backup. I'll be there in no time."
"Zaun's with me every fight. This time's no different."
"Sweet, we're here. Whoa, crazy weapons! This team's great. Let's go!"
"Ayy, this is cool. Lotsa places to run. Charging up oughta be quick."
"If it matters to my team, it matters to me."
"Man, I should've packed more snacks."
"Anyone have a plan? No? No problem."
"Everyone's counting on me. No way I let them down."
"Mistakes made are lessons learned."
"Best thing I can do is fight when others can't."
"I belong here. We all belong here."
"I faced worse in Zaun. We can win."
"Ah, fresh air. A rare treat."
"Lightning in a gun coming through."
"Gun's not broken yet. Better keep it that way."
"Fight's gettin' messy. At least I'm consistent."
"Never seen so little traffic. Do I miss it?"
"Gotta hurry. People need my spark!"
"Giving up's too easy."
"Do or die. I'm all in."
"This won't be perfect, but life never is."
"Quick feet, quick trigger."
"I don't leave others behind."
"They're like the chem-barons. Talk big, but they'll break."
"No one catches me. Except for my aunt. Man, I can't get anything past her."
"I stood up for my community. I can stand up for others, too."
"Oh, wow. They're really out to get us. I gotta be faster."
"Run fast, charge up, shoot the bad guys. Easy enough."
"Grandma said: 'Never back down from a fight.' Bless that woman."
"Blitz, you used to help me climb the clock tower. That arm of yours is no joke."
"A gun and a badge don't make you a hero."
"Ekko, you don't have to fight alone. Us Zaun kids, we stick together."
"Ezreal, you're the type of guy that's not worth my time."
"Professor, don't make me blow up your inventions again."
"Janna, you do exist! Your wind, my lightning. Let's make a storm!
"Hoy, Jinx! How many rockets you making me dodge this time, huh?"
"Pretty songs don't fix problems, Seraphine. Actions do."
"A real rat with a crossbow? Can't believe I owe my Dad money."
"Vi, you could've fought for Zaun. But you chose not to."
"Is that another me? Or someone else?"
"No one's ever asked me to zap them, Ziggs. That's new."
"You wanna mess with us? Deal with me, first."
"That's a lotta talk. Let's see if you can back it up."
"If I can just, uh, get this to work. Ah!"
"Come on! Charge already!"
"I'm not messin' around."
"I'll get them, I promise!"
"Hoy! Hear that buzz?"
"Whew! Gotta recharge."
"No one steals my thunder."
"Never count me out."
"And Dad said I was stubborn."
"Quite the swing, Blitz. Let's have another go."
"Well, Caitlyn. Out of touch, out of luck."
"You can do better, Ekko. Rewind and rematch."
"Liked your gauntlet, Ez. Everything else? Meh."
"Back to the blueprints you go!"
"Janna, come on! Don't let people's faith go to waste."
"That's enough animal-shaped guns for now."
"Beautiful lyrics, Sera. If only you'd backed them up."
"Twitch, if you want cheese-flavored trash, just ask."
"Vi, I've tried punching through life. Doesn't work."
"Probably a weird dream. Nothing to worry about."
"Do I smell burnt squirrel?"
"Look at them scramble! We crushed it!"
"Wow, we rock! Wait, where's the last one?"
"Woo, that's five! We gotta celebrate!"
"One sec! Gun could use a little tinkering."
"Hold up! There's a gear in the shop with my name on it."
"Wait! I forgot something! Just stay alive, okay?"
"People need... me..."
"Come on, Zeri. Fight to winâ€”remember that."
"Ugh, might've rushed that one. It's okay, I'll do better."
"Snap out of it. I can do this. We can do this."
"If the chem-barons couldn't keep me down, no one can."
