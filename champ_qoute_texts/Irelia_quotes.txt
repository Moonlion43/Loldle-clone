"Fight for the First Lands!"
"We will live on... Either in victory, or in the scars we leave on them!"
"Let them come! This land will be their graveyard!"
"They await my words... What should I tell them...?"
"I have but one life to give for Ionia. I must make it count."
"We stand on the bones of the ones who came before us. For them, we fight!"
"Yup, they're ice blades. Don't stick your tongue to them."
"Give them an inch, they'll take a kingdom."
"They came for our magics. They'll pay with their lives."
"Peace requires two participants."
"Their weapons are great—but our will is greater."
"My dance has forty-two forms. They'll only see one."
"Even if they kill me, they'll still have to fight the land."
"I am both the tranquil sea and the tempest."
"My O-ma always said I had angry feet."
"These blades were whetted on the bones of tyrants."
"Better times there were, and will be again."
"Do we want to be safe, or free? The choice is ours."
"Remember what's been lost; fight for what hasn't been."
"Zelos told the worst jokes... How I miss them."
"Be the leader they need."
"We are the children of the First Lands; and we will not be slaves!"
"I move to unsung melodies and unbeaten rhythms."
"I carry a lot more than these blades."
"Ours is the land of magic, and that is worth dying for."
"There's a saying: 'Never fight Ionians on their home soil'."
"They didn't kill us all."
"Harm no one... Unless they come for your home."
"I never meant to lead. I fought, and they followed."
"Each form has a name known only to the wind. At least that's what O-ma said..."
"None can do what I do; so I will do it."
"Stay ready, and there is no need to get ready."
"A mastered weapon needs no haft."
"Dance with what brought you—in this case, blades."
"We are the only masters of our fate!"
"I am not unfriendly! I am a warm and caring person."
"Freedom has a demanding rhythm."
"I have walked the silver plains and fished the rivers of grass. The land knows me."
"Peace must sometimes be bought with blood."
"I've never killed a person... just a lot of Noxians."
"Of course I can fight. I grew up with four siblings!"
"We do this for those who came before us, and those who come next."
"To live under a boot, is not to live."
"The voices of my brothers still carry on the wind..."
"They'll know me as the last to lay down her weapons."
"Ionia is our only home."
"Where they fell, freedom grew."
"An ocean separates us; for good reason."
"I really should've stretched first... Oh well."
"I remember when I danced for fun."
"Act, and the whole world will move!"
"What strange power works through me, I do not know."
"Live today like you're going to die tomorrow."
"Never stop learning. There's always a form you don't know."
"I pledged myself to darkness. It has called in the debt."
"I'm doomed to carry these blades... forever."
"Who will feed the night's spirit?"
"I once served the light, until it cast me out."
"Like a knife in the dark."
"The blades demand an offering."
"The rest of the plane? Eh, I don't need it."
"Hurt and subvert—that's how I do it."
"Bring them down, from the inside."
"If the mission goes to hell, there's always the blades."
"Stay under their radar—and if that doesn't work, cut their heads off."
"If they find me, they'll regret it."
"I have walked the ice plains and fished the rivers of ice... The ice knows me."
"The cold? Eh, it never bothered me."
"This ice never melts. Just like our will!"
"The frost gave me life... Now it takes it!"
"Hope they brought armor... and a sweater."
"Sharp and cold—hurts two ways."
"Where they fell, the Lotus grew."
"These petals cut deep."
"They see only the flower. But these roots run deep."
"Peace is not perennial. It must be constantly sowed."
"The seeds of our order carry on the wind."
"Beauty can grow from the murkiest water."
"You do not know burden until you've seen a thousand people hanging on your every word."
"I did not light my O-ma's lantern. I don't want her to see this slaughter."
"Father, mother, Zelos, O-ma, Ohn, Kye, little Ruu... None of them ever had a chance."
"Stop your flirting Nine-Tails, it's time to take up arms!"
"I admire your spirit. Your attitude, not so much."
"In Ionia we have over two hundred species of talking dragon! Sorry, not impressed."
"Ugh. Your songs are impossible to dance to."
"We don't need legends to save us. We do our own fighting."
"Nice technique. I miss your old hair though. Why'd you change it?"
"IONIAAAAA! Hmm, that's me, if I was you."
"Eugh, your twirling technique is atrocious."
"Somewhere, a forest is missing its idiot."
"Your 'peace' leads to nothing but extermination!"
"You claim to speak for the Spirit... as if it doesn't move my blades."
"Your dances are good, but they lack a certain... soul."
"You want redemption? Join me, and kill your masters!"
"You know what it's like to lose everything. So you know why I must fight."
"Lobbing poison from your ship doesn't make you a genius. It makes you a coward!"
"Really... Flying blades? Get your own thing, sister!"
"Make yourself useful! Return your crystals to the earth."
"Were you the one who brought the ravens? Because I think they just got caught in my blades!"
"For a 'brilliant tactician' you sure pick unwinnable fights!"
"Did you wanna lose the other one too?"
"Once an Ionian, always an Ionian. You'll never be one of them."
"Where did you go wrong? Is there anything redeemable in you...? It's time to find out."
"You dance to your own rhythm; but the land is beating the drums of war."
"Keep your 'balance', ours is the only side that matters."
"Soon, they will grieve in your village."
"Humans. Vastayans. We are all Ionians, facing a common threat!"
"Can you not hear the music? I shall enjoy watching you trip."
"Here are our terms. You leave, and you live."
"Raise a hand to us, and you'll find it missing."
"We are all creations of the Spirit. Still—I must kill you."
"Everyone has something clever to say... Until the blades find their throat!"
"Wait, wait, wait, wait..."
"Contrary to what you've heard, I have a great sense of humor."
"Give them no foothold!"
"Show them no weakness."
"Look, a dance partner!"
"This dance kills despots!"
"Oho... you've got lead feet."
"Slice through them!"
"Careful—I hit back."
"Always attack at an angle."
"We stand or perish!"
"You'll rue this day!"
"Balance be damned; wipe them out!"
"There is no retreat!"
"It's all in the footwork."
"Still mind, swift movement."
"We are sharpest where we break!"
"The blades fly in sync."
"Strike fast, and without misstep!"
"Who dares walk this land?"
"Time for a dogfight!"
"I said, tray tables up!"
"Time for some sabotage!"
"I'm spotted, engage!"
"We have contact with target!"
"Behold—the avalanche of blades!"
"True ice, true aim!"
"Ionia still stands!"
"Remember the Placidium!"
"Stop their retreat!"
"Perfection of form."
"Do try to keep pace."
"I dance on your grave."
"And... back to center."
"It's always the blade you don't see coming."
"They made their choice."
"Okay! I'm warmed up."
"I just love the way blood pools on ice."
"So pure, so lethal."
"All things wilt in time."
"Always mind your footing."
"A successful ambush!"
"Leave them. As a warning to others!"
"Killing you won't bring them back... But it still felt good."
"That's for my O-ma."
"Bury them in Noxus! This ground will not have them."
"Grace bends, where strength breaks."
"Checkpoint breached!"
"A sword with a grip? How quaint."
"Doesn't fly, but it cuts nonetheless."
"Throw it in with the others, let's see if it flies."
"Steals their life, like they stole our land... I like it."
"Gives life as it takes it... much like the Spirit."
"Such a sordid weapon... but effective."
"I don't care who made it, so long as it kills invaders."
"A beast of a blade for beastly foes!"
"Woe to all who would harm us now!"
"The ultimate in homeland protection!"
"Land, name, and nation. Long may they live!"
"Give all and the Spirit gives back!"
"Now, watch the bastards fall!"
"The blades are honed; let us test their edges."
"I will light their lanterns. They will see victory."
"And now... I dance alone."
"I survive. And now I must earn it."
"Your sacrifice will not be in vain."
"You will be avenged, brave ones..."
"The eyes are the first line of defense."
"My guard is never down!"
"Always expect them."
"I know they'll be back..."
"Stay watchful, stay prepared."
"This time, we'll be waiting for them."
"Take out their necks! The heads will follow."
"Shall we fight back?"
"Freedom is yours! Take it!"
"Press on! We can quit when we're dead!"
"Keep your form! Move as one!"
"Stand strong! Nothing can break us!"
"For the bones of our fathers, and the temples of our gods!"
"Give me your all! I swear it will not be wasted!"
"Make them remember, so they do not return!"
"Remember why we fight!"
"We do not die this day!"
"Cast off your shackles!"
"Let me take the lead!"
"I do not want your praise. Just your sweat and your blood!"
"Dig in! This is where we make our stand!"
"I will not let them harm you!"
"Yes! Catch them unaware."
"Of course. I'll set the trap."
"Brilliant. They'll never see it coming."
"I'll draw them in, you take their flank!"
"Right, hit them from two sides."
"Well. Time to find my feet."
"When no one's around, I dance for myself."
"It's quiet now... Time to find my own rhythm."
"We must stay moving. Keep them guessing."
"I am the great river, flowing where I please."
"Coming in to refuel."
"Requesting permission to land."
"The Spirit revives me... I will not disappoint."
"My form was off... Can't let them see."
"It appears my dance continues."
"Ugh! Need to get my rhythm back."
"This is far from over. We have not yet begun to fight."
"I bloom again and again."
"We defended to the last!"
