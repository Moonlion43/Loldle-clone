"A new moon is rising."
"Follow no false light."
"The moon also rises."
"They would not listen."
"Chosen of the moon."
"They could not break me."
"I cannot turn back."
"I speak only truth."
" They called me a heretic. Now they are dead!"
"The moon will rise. The night will last forever!"
"Bring down the sun."
"They leave me no choice."
"Blind to the truth."
