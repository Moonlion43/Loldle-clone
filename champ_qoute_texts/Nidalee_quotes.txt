"The wild calls. I answer."
"You are right to fear me!"
"I delight in this silence. The quiet before the hunt."
"I am never alone. My tribe lives in my heart, and in my spear."
"Prey hide in the sounds of the wild—listen, then strike."
"The  brass-bones think they can conquer the wilderness, but nature cannot be tamed."
"I am always Nidalee."
"Protecting my pack is my purpose."
"This land will be the grave of all who trespass!"
"Trespassers are easy to track."
"I am the wild's protector."
"I have led my tribe for generations."
"My family, is my strength."
"Our future is in our Pakiti."
"Clawless hands need a spear."
"The jungle never sleeps."
"See... Listen... Focus..."
"Instinct guides my steps."
"I take only what I need."
"I carve my spears from poachers' bones."
"My quarry won't escape."
"Soft of paw, light of foot."
"I do not question my two forms."
"Prowling on two legs felt strange once."
"I will always be my mother's cub..."
"A hunter's instincts are inherited. A hunter's skills are honed."
"My mother's title came to me heavy—with Kiilashi blood. With it, I keep my family alive."
"My tribe calls itself 'the Pakaa'. Only foreign prey call us 'Kashdaji'."
"I pay no attention to the affairs of men—until they make me their enemy."
"I do not understand the nature of humans; nothing is gained by pointless slaughter."
"The jungle lives in my bones. The Pakaa, in my heart."
"There is no need to climb above the canopy... But I enjoy watching the stars."
"I am pack-mother, sister, daughter. I have no need to be anything else!"
"For generations, I have seen and survived nature's many seasons."
"Famine and drought kill predator and prey alike."
"Human, beast, Vastaya... These words mean nothing to me."
"How would you prefer to die: by spear, or by claw?"
"You are lost. Let me show you where you belong!"
"Leave, now! I will not warn you again."
"I have defended my home from worse!"
"Hunters in the sun, can miss the beasts in the shadows, K'Sante."
"Claws and spears bring death; the Kindred only finish what I start!"
"Little firebug, our Pakiti trust you—but they are naive."
"Love takes as many shapes as you do, Neeko."
"How long can you survive outside your golden palace, princess?"
"I spare no Kiilash, Rengar—meet me in the hunt!"
"You think you understand the jungle, shaman; but you will always be an outsider."
"Oho... Are you lost, little Pakiti?"
"I will chase you from this land, brass-bones!"
"I may seem like you, Vastaya—but we are not the same."
"I don't need this to tear out your throat!"
"I don't like when prey talks back."
"Meow... meow-meow, meow-meow-meow-meow... You got that?"
"Oh, hahahaha-- Can't laugh with a spear through your neck!"
"Every hunter knows that core strength is key!"
"Your marrow; my feast!"
"My spear will take you down!"
"This is not where you belong, beast!"
"You dare threaten my tribe?"
"Let's see who is top of the food chain!"
"Run, and I'll give chase."
"Hunter, or monster—my prey sees no difference."
"You know how this ends!"
"Your death will be swift."
"This is the way it must be!"
"Hahahaha, my prey now!"
"Heart of the Pakaa!"
"A meal for the worms."
"Pakaa protect our own."
"This will make a good lesson for the Pakiti."
"They never heed my warnings!"
"Nothing will be wasted."
"Young defender, rest with pride."
"My spear is the true death!"
"You wandered too far, little firebug."
"Dogs? Really, Naafiri?"
"Neeko... My world feels empty, without you."
"Justice, Rengar. Blood, for blood."
"Once an outsider, always an outsider, shaman."
"Ohoho, you are fiercer than you think, Yuumi!"
"Never return, brass-bones."
"I believe this is called a... Kebab?"
"I claim your bones, for my next spear!"
"Through heart and spine!"
"A skilled hunter, makes a swift kill."
"The trespassers are next!"
"Ah, I can hear the wind again."
"The prowl begins anew."
"The sky is pack-mother to the world: ever-faithful, and protective."
"Guide me, pack-sisters, as I once guided you."
"My tribe will not starve this day—I swear it!"
"I learned to make tools by watching villagers. Don't have their place."
"What new tales will the outsiders spin, of their 'monstrous Kashdaji queen'?"
"Guide me home... Kupakaa..."
"Pakiti to feed, and no time to lose."
"Trespassers call me 'Kashdaji queen'. I will teach them my real name."
"They will soon know who prowls this land."
"My prey still lives; but I have not lost its scent."
"I love playing cat and mouse."
"I see you're no stranger to the wild."
