"I heard that the royal family of Camaroar used to offer rings to my ancestors. Ha, those things must've been humongous."
"My name's Ignacarious Gigantareno Rex Le Spes Offerentis, but my human friend named me Smolder."
"Here he is! The most splendiferous prize of  Camaroar! Me!" Smolder imitates the echo of a crowd. "...Aw, yeah! Way to go, Smolder...!"
"My wings flap, my sneezes are flame-nados, and my super fire beam breaths are only getting stronger! No more getting treated like a hatchling!"
"I don't take orders from anyone. But, actually, I was just gonna explore around here anyway."
"Heyyy, mom... I made some new friends, uh, I'm gonna go play with them real quick!"
"There's so much room to run around!"
"Gotta stay on my claws. Like mom always says, 'Rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!'"
"Ooh, what's over there?"
"Oh, no! It's a dragon! Aah, run away! Aah!"
"Ugh, flying is hard."
"Marino says people think there's no more imperial dragons. But he never lets me prove them wrong."
"Aw, Camaroar sounds so fun. Can we go now?"
"Ha, an imperial dragon does whatever he feels like doing."
"Skies? Land? Flame? Haha. I was born to rule 'em all."
"Everything's mine to play with."
"Ugh, I'm so hungry I could eat a whole bunch of  gromps!"
"Do you see anything fun up there?"
"Ooh, I'll find 'em."
"Hey, mom? What are the fire thingies next to my ears called?"
"Imperial dragons are the best dragons! My mom says so."
"Marinos' family is HUGE compared to just me and my mom. I know mom's mentioned some grandmother Viper lady, but I've never met her."
"I'm gonna be big and strong one day. Then they'll be sorry."
"I'm gonna teach my new friends all my favorite games, like finders-not-keepers. They run around and collect a bunch of shiny stuff, and I get to keep it."
"One time, I sneezed and burned down a whole forest. No, for real."
"Humans are so weird. It's like one minute they're all small and round, and the next, they're all thin and wrinkly."
"Why's she gotta hover over me all the time? I can take care of myself."
"Uh, m-maybe it's good no one else can understand her."
"Whoa, you're the loudest mom in the entire world!"
"My best friend Marinos used to tell me all sorts of stories, like the one about the kingdom of ghosts."
"Mom, it's just a story."
"'Kay, I guess she's heard it before..."
"Oh, my mom says 'hi' too."
"Roar! Beware the dragon's power! Hehe."
"One day, I'll be so big that, if we played hide and seek, you could hide in my mouth."
"Huh, whatcha doing?"
"Why are you wearing a crown, Mr. Airyline Sol?"
"Huh. Why's that armored guy smell like dragon?"
"Whoa! Scary ghost lady!"
"Wow! How'd you get so good at pretending to be people, Shyvana?"
"Whoa, he must be the king of  the ghost kingdom! I've gotta tell Marinos."
"Why didn't anyone tell me we were s'pposed to dress up?"
"Mom says I'm not supposed to eat youâ€”but I'm too fast for her to stop me!"
"Well, my mom's the biggest, baddest dragon around, and she's gonna burn you!"
"Well, my mom works for Riot, and she's gonna ban you!"
"Hoho, look at me, I'm people!"
"You want some fire?"
"My archa-memenasis!"
"Look what I can do!"
"Oh, are you one of those 'elementary' dragons?"
"What do Elder Dragons do anyway? Is your power being old?"
"Everybody's invited to the barbecue!"
"Ugh! Soot in my snoot again!"
"My nose is all bleh."
"Phew, that's better."
"Hohoho, you're in trouble!"
"Whoa, did you see that?!"
"Argh, next time...!"
"Ohoho, yeah! Did you see that, mom? I smoked 'em!"
"Their mom shoulda taught 'em not to pick fights they can't win!"
"Whoa! I thought he'd be a lot tougher!"
"Can ghosts even die?"
"Shyvana! Why'd you have to be so mean?"
"Hey, mom, check out his crown!"
"Woah, you sure don't like him."
"Check it out, mom! They're, like, creature people."
"Aww, I don't like hurting the little cute ones."
"Go, Smolder~! Go, Smolder~!"
"Oooh, ahhh! Mwahahahahahaha, FOOLISH MORTALS! ...Hey, where'd everybody go?"
"I-I swear it was like that when I found it...!"
"What a nifty pile of rocks."
"Aah! Oh, no! Not our fortress! Aw, no!"
"Guess you didn't pay attention in dragon practice!"
"Who's the best dragon? I'm the best dragon!"
"Blegh! Burning void goo."
"Can I get something? Pretty, pretty please!"
"Look at all this stuff and things!"
"I was just looking!"
"Are we best friends now?"
"Oh, yeah, right... 'Thank you!'"
"Need a little help!"
"A hide-and-seek champion!"
"Have no fear, Smolder is near!"
"Aw, but I'm not done yet!"
"Errands? I hate errands."
"Okay, but you promise we'll be right back."
"Oh, boy! Dinner's ready!"
"They'd better not be having too much fun without me..."
"Aww, I've gotta work on my landing."
"This is gonna be fun!"
"Okay, okay, I'm up."
"Mom, stop, you're embarrassing me!"
