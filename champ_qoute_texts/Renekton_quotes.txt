"As I live, all will die!"
"All will suffer as I have!"
"Shred their fragile bodies!"
"They will feel pain they've never imagined!"
"Trapped in a box so long Xerath, they never should have let us out!"
"Xerath, we will give them what they deserve..."
"There is no retreat."
"Destruction approaches."
"Who's next on the chopping block?"
"Nothing will stop me!"
"Nasus cannot escape me forever!"
"The slaughter will never end!"
"You should have done a better job locking me away, Nasus!"
"You are not my brother, traitor!"
"Come back when you've collected all the bits of yourself!"
"What? Do I have someone in my teeth?"
"Embrace the jaws of death."
"I'll leave them in pieces!"
"Bask in their blood!"
"Light meat, dark meat, it's all the same."
"No suffering is too great!"
"I will spare no one!"
"I will gut you all!"
"I will tear the world asunder!"
"Now you will know agony!"
"I'll leave you all in pieces!"
"You will not escape me, Nasus!"
"One day, you will suffer!"
