"The guilty will know agony."
"I have no grace to give."
"No mercy, no forgiveness. Mortal or monster, all will fall."
"Every step forward..."
"I move toward the vengeance I deserve."
"It will ruin this land, Varus!"
"Many stand against us."
"Must they all die...?"
"May they rot where my arrows rain."
"Naafiri, you claim unity is power. Power within me—and against our enemies. Let us see, together."
"I faced terrors... Until I became one."
" Darkin, or human... I was always a weapon."
"A land of riddled bodies marks my return."
"I will bury the world that buried me."
"My hosts dwell on a humanity long gone..."
"The magic that sealed me became my blight."
"Compassion... is but a whisper."
"An arrow should not question its course."
"All who cross me will be made my targets."
"War must quiet my mind..."
"Valmar. Join me in retribution."
"If I must. For Kai..."
"You walk a dark path, Varus."
"My kin will scourge this world!"
"Vengenace is power!"
"Your tormentors are gone..."
"But my hatred seethes."
"Grieve for the lost."
"Why? No one grieved for me."
"Archers shoot to kill."
"We've fallen so far..."
"Forgiveness takes nothing!"
"It costs everything."
"I need not humanity."
"Yet it lives within you."
"Which burns brighter—the fire of retribution, or the heart's light?"
"You dove into my prison, humans. Drown with me..."
"Valeeva, Xolaani, Naafiri. What unique ambitions you have, my sisters."
"Mortals once used me to confront the Darkin. I see no greater war than facing my brethren."
"If you must speak, humans: let your voices be the howl of arrows."
"No peace will endure once I find my fellow Darkin."
"Valmar and Kai urge redemption... Is it so beyond me?"
"I aim to save my people!"
"As did I. Now my aim leaves ruin in its wake."
"What are the Darkin?"
"The pain and rage you mortals dared forget."
"It's the first step towards redemption!"
"This bow is a heavy burden..."
"Feel its hatred, Kai. Let it take root."
"This world wronged us, Valmar. I will make it weep."
"Are these the fields, of home?"
"Let go of Ionia! Find comfort in carnage."
"Varus, you were once human."
"I cannot go back. I must be more."
"What strength do you cling to, sons of Ionia?"
"To the last breath."
"There is no end in sight!"
"We'll walk together again..."
"How rare for such will to persist."
"We were all warriors."
"And our honor damned us."
"Pray you fall swiftly. Every cut will be anguish."
"You may run, but you will not be spared."
"No plea for mercy will stay my hand."
"Brave enough to oppose me; fool enough to die."
"A sword has no reach, brother—no aim."
"Aatrox, brother, the double 'A' thing is absurd and you know it."
"'Warmother', Ashe? You are a child, unworthy of the bow."
"Lady of vengeance—you should side with me."
"Karma, I've made a monster of your people."
"Rhaast. Perhaps we should warn our siblings about... Ionian vessels."
"Rhaast, control yourself. You make the rest of us look foolish, brother."
"You wish unity for us, sister. Can this be realized in battle?"
"Hounds, Naafiri? You make me grateful for my vessels."
"That blade felled my kin once, Sivir. Never again."
"Ascended, your sun-born greatness meets a dark demise."
"We were once immortal brothers, sisters, dark kin! Now, we are disgraced."
"Spite and pain await you!"
"Weak posturing for someone soon to crumble."
"Pride will not save you. Learn to obey..."
"Such idiocy begs to be silenced by my arrow."
"Your body will stain the earth."
"Even hope will perish."
"Despair finds its mark."
"I give not salvation!"
"Undo all that is good."
"They will die where they stand."
"All I see, all within reach."
"Let corruption seep in."
"Death does not absolve you."
"Pain... My gift to you."
"The life in your eyes wanes."
"You will die faster than you could run."
"Your long-overdue end."
"A small piece of a greater retribution."
"Speak your regrets to the dirt."
"Breathe your last; feel every wound."
"Corrupted and cut down."
"The fate of those who defy me."
"None escape my aim."
"One arrow to finish everything."
"Perhaps you deserve oblivion, brother."
"I am the bow, Ashe."
"There is no revenge but mine, Kalista."
"You'll save neither yourself, nor your people, Karma."
"Rhaast, find two vessels next time—trust me."
"The pack cursed you, sister. It only created more targets."
"Sivir—your bones and blade will turn to dust."
"A taste of bloodshed."
"Let this be a warning to the rest."
"Slaughter is the right of my bow and my blood!"
"My work is not done...!"
"This form must not fail..."
"In quiet moments, I see the memories of Darkin and men..."
"A moment of rest—before the massacre resumes."
"Enjoy this respite, sons of Ionia. It will not last."
"This calm is nothing compared to the deathly stillness I will bring."
"The cries of the guilty will fill the air."
"Valmar, Kai... I..."
"No...! Humans die..."
"Valmar, Kai—do not divide my focus."
"So long as this bow remains, I live."
"Again. Only cowards flee their fate."
"I am Darkin. Even death itself will not stop me!"
"Another chance to choose peace..."
"I am a weapon. What choice do I have?"
"To see my revenge through."
"They only want to survive!"
"They forfeit their lives."
