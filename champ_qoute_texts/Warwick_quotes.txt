"Blood runs... they all run."
"They fear me. They should."
"The chains are broken... the beast is free."
"The blood you spilled calls to me."
"Oh, what a day. What a bloody day."
"Violence supercharged!"
"Can't save you all... don't want to."
"I became the monster I always was."
"The man I was... I killed him first."
"The memories come back every time you scream."
"I can smell everything."
"Vengeance is only a step behind you."
"You made the monster."
"Zaun will watch you bleed, and it will do nothing."
"All the blood you've spilled brought me here."
"Zaun will fight back!"
"You know what you've done."
"The city is my hunting ground."
"This place is familiar..."
"The beast grows stronger."
"Run... while you can."
"I know Zaun's streets like the back of my claws."
"What have you done!?"
"Seeking... hunting..."
"Can't... save you...!"
"I became... monster!"
"Nine tails to chase!"
"Zaun has enough shadows."
"There's more to kill in a plague rat. You're all machine."
"So deep in Piltover's pockets, I can only see your hat."
"Progress is just what Piltovans call murder."
"I'll pick my teeth with your legs!"
"Rewind too far, and you'll be back in my teeth!"
"The one person in Zaun who runs to the past."
"I'll show you pain!"
"Which one of you is the wolf?"
"From a roar to a scream!"
"You can't even kill an insect."
"Zaun gave me claws long before you did."
"Can't outrun your mistakes!"
"You're going to need more bandages!"
"I remember what you did!"
"Eat your heart out."
"There are more rats than men in Zaun."
"And I thought the Chem-Barons were vermin."
"Which one of us is the monster?"
"Who taught you how to punch?"
"The fear in your eyes. I've seen it before."
"Three arms... and no claws."
"I don't know what you are, but I hope you bleed!"
"Zaun has enough shadows."
"First I'll kill you, and then I'll--- yordle!"
"Yordles. The alpha predator."
"Violence can be death—or a way of life."
"I ran these streets—now it's your turn to run."
"I'll do a trick for a Warwick snack!"
"Scratch behind my ears..."
"Who's a good boy? I am!"
"Blood is the price."
"You'll answer to me."
"It's not the beast you should be afraid of."
"Killing, I remember."
"If you die, how many live?"
"The killing stops when Zaun is free."
"A monster's inside you... I'll tear it out!"
"Give in to the beast."
"Like men to the slaughter."
"It takes a monster to gut one."
"You hurt them, I hurt you."
"Less talking, more biting!"
"This pain is nothing."
"Give in... the beast!"
"Men... slaughter..."
"Killing... remember!"
"If I don't kill you, Zaun will."
"Back to killing Chem-Barons."
"More scars—as if I didn't have enough."
"You killed Warwick, but left the beast."
"I almost felt that."
"One thing you should know: I honour my debts."
"I can smell your fear!"
"I'll eat your heart, Starchild."
