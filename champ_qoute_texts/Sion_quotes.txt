"Rest is for the living."
"When does the killing start?"
"It's been too long."
"I hate this waiting."
"The quiet... eats at me."
"What toll have I paid?"
"These wounds bring no pain."
"This hunger... it gnaws."
"How many battles have I won?"
"Where is the thrill of carnage?"
"I need a slaughter!"
"Why do I feel... nothing?"
"No... pain... no... feeling... but hunger..."
"Slay the strong, trample the weak!"
"Winning is like breathing."
"Break their will and their bones."
"Blood is the wine of victory."
"Noxus suffers no cowards."
"Cowardice will be met with death."
"Only cowards fear death."
"Forget the faces of the slain."
"Victory is soaked in blood."
"Death had its chance."
"I know you... I want to remember killing you!"
"One of us will finally die today!"
"Time to cut your strings, puppet!"
"We've clashed a thousand times... no more!"
"Next in line, next to die."
"I killed you once... I'll kill you again!"
"Today, we'll see if ghosts can bleed."
"I'll plant that banner in your corpse!"
"Even death trembles before me."
"You will be privileged to die... under my boot!"
"I am not your pawn, Swain!"
"You are weak, Swain! You are no leader!"
"You are not my general!"
"I don't care what your name is!"
"Your snapping bones are music to my ears!"
"More grist for the mill of war!"
"Your bones will pave my road to glory!"
"I had a funny bone, then I crushed it. Laugh, worm!"
"Your puny body is the only joke here."
"Your... puny body is the only joke here."
"The mewling of your orphan children amuses me! How's that for funny?"
"It's murdering time!"
"How many Jarvans must I kill?"
"Four Jarvans, and you're all still failures! That is funny."
"You look just like your ancestor: dead!"
"Why don't I have coverage for prosthetics?"
"So, uh, Urgot. We can't hang out any more. I'm cool now."
"I'll use their bones to pick my teeth."
"Ally, enemy... I don't care."
"I taste blood in the air."
"They'll never find all your pieces."
"Another corpse for the pile."
"I will kill you all!"
"My axe is getting cold!"
"I'll pull you apart!"
"I'll whet my axe on your bones!"
"I'll drown you in your own blood!"
"I'll rip the meat from your bones!"
"I'll rip your head from your spine!"
"Your cries disgust me!"
"I'll grind you to dust!"
"I'll drink from your skull!"
"Shattered earth and bodies!"
"Broken stone, broken bones!"
"A black eye for the earth!"
"Leave no stone unbroken!"
"Even the ground trembles!"
"Heat... and... rage!"
"Think you can take me?"
"You can't even scratch me!"
"The din of the dying!"
"You can't hide behind lackeys!"
"Is this what passes for war?!"
"I'll crush you all!"
"Nothing will stop me!"
"I'll bury it in their skulls."
"Hand it over before I kill you."
"If it breaks, so will you."
"Another trinket to be shattered."
"I will drench it in their blood."
"No mere spell will stop me."
"A sword lacks heft."
"This cleaver... will be red soon."
"This is not the first dead king's weapon I've taken."
"Yes... I like this weapon."
"Nothing will keep me from battle."
"Every step will crack the earth."
"Good enough to stomp insects."
"These will wade through the blood of thousands."
"I'll shatter the gates of Demacia with this hammer!"
"This will stop their flailing!"
"Do you feel a shiver down your spine?"
"Cold as the grip of death!"
"I'll feel their bodies grow cold."
"This will sever a thousand heads."
"They will break first."
"Protection from the bites of gnats."
"A dark omen for my enemies!"
"All will burn in my wake."
"They'll beg as they burn."
"Leave no wound unanswered."
"This has seen many battles."
"This is the only fortress I need!"
"Battle scarred... I like it."
"This was made for war, as am I!"
"Let them sneak, then let them die."
"Where are you going? Nowhere!"
"This is the ground you'll die on!"
"This battle is done."
"They can cower a little longer."
"There's death to deal."
"Come beat me if you want to win."
"We'll see you soon."
