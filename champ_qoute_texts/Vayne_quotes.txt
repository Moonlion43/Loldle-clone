"Let us hunt those who have fallen to darkness."
"I smell black magics."
"Evil lurks around every corner."
"In the dark, all is laid bare."
"The shadows are to be feared."
"The dark should fear me."
"I hear the innocent cry out."
"Hitting me is like boxing with shadows!"
"Joke? What do you mean?"
"I have no time for nonsense."
"I release them from their pain."
"I bring swift death."
"Cleansing blood with silver."
"They will be purified."
"Silver of the moon."
"The purifying element."
"Time for reckoning..."
