"Happy to sit this one out."
"Live each day as if it's your first."
"The sunshine tastes so good today."
"Feels good to stretch the ole beanstalks!"
"What a wonderful day! Gooseberries would love it."
"Hmm, it's getting cloudy. I hope it drizzles chocolate soon!"
"I can't wait to spread a little sweetness."
"Hm, now where did I leave my roots?"
"I am never lost in the wilderness... only in conversations."
"I grow my own food."
"I tread lightly so as not to hurt the dandelions."
"One day, I'll root in one place and be everywhere."
"I wonder what the ducks are plotting today."
"Daisy stampede when no one is watching."
"I follow only the sun! A-and sometimes a river. This one time, a scorpion..."
"Never trust a butterfly with a secret."
"Sun and rain are the only magic I need."
"No one who wanders is every truly lost."
"Oh, look, a happy little cloud!"
"Life is such a strange miracle."
"Laugh like a hyena, and friends will gallop to your side."
"Every river reaches the ocean in its own way."
"I wonder what adventure today has in store for all of us."
"Animals have more to offer than warm pelts and meat."
"Everything is connected in the strangest ways."
"I'm having another eye-opening day."
"Sprint like a snail, and you will never twist your ankle."
"It's reassuring how alone we aren't."
"I find that the stranger life gets, the more it seems to make sense."
"Nothing beats the smell of vegetation."
"The cleverness of mushrooms always surprises me!"
"Brush just tickles my fancy."
"I should go swimming later!"
"Trees love tickling each other's branches."
"Ladybugs should really befriend inchworms."
"I love how the grass is fluffy on my toes."
"I want to put my toes in the river."
"Cookies are their own food group."
"I need to make a gumdrop."
"Jawbreakers should be called heartbreakers."
"Candy really ties the world together."
"Always judge people based on how they treat a dessert."
"Caramel never leaves a tooth behind."
"Everyone is someone's favorite candy bar."
"Oh, the sun's making me awfully melty."
"In butterscotch we trust."
"Cake makes any meeting a party."
"Pastries and pies hate waiting for people to finish supper.
"Never trust a jelly roll to do a donut job."
"Pudding is meant to be stirred."
"I have never met a jelly bean I didn't love."
"Life is so much more beautiful than death."
"Finally, someone who understands nature like I do!"
"Mountain man, it's me! The tree guy!"
"Are you going to Treemoot this year? I'm going to dress up as a sassafras!"
"Obviously, you're not a gopher."
"No need to be so thorny."
"Have an unusual day."
"Be grateful for the breeze and the grass beneath your feet."
"Let reverence for life take root in your heart."
"All life is precious, yes... even yours."
"May the sun warm you, all of your days."
"I'm a tree-hugger, you should know that about me!"
"Hmm. Fragrant, with notes of wormwood."
"Have an Ivern-crisp apple!" Ivern whispers. "Don't ask how I make them."
"Be grateful for this moment. And this one. Oh, and this one. Oh, and this one's good too!"
"Worst part about being made of candy? Bugs."
"That gets funnier every time I hear it!"
"That's the funniest thing I've ever heard!" Ivern trails off while laughing.
"No one expects the sneaky clover."
"Surprises sting the most."
"Nature strikes unseen."
"Who did that?!" Ivern whispers. "...It was me."
"The chameleons would be proud."
"Uh-- the ferns did it."
"Where did that come from?!"
"Nothing in here but us, uh... stalks of grass!!"
"Nature isn't always gentle."
"Let me help you grow."
"Switch to a greener path."
"Trust me, you need this."
"Harm revisits those who harm."
"So this is how the scorpion feels."
"How very hornet of me."
"The scorpion must scorp."
"When a tree hits you, listen."
"You forced my limb."
"Some buds need a little push to blossom."
"It's okay, Gromp is a slow learner too."
"Huh, I can be thorny too!"
"Glad you saved room for dessert."
"No one escapes the bonbon horde!"
"This is bittersweet for me."
"I have marshmallow knuckles."
"Watch out, licorice stings."
"Sprinkles never say die!"
"There is always room for sweets."
"It's raining peppermints!"
"My fists are named Cotton and Candy."
"Get ready for a toothache."
"My fists are named Sweet and Sour.
"Dessert is mandatory."
"You are far too tart!"
"Let's skip right to dessert."
"I get the feeling dragons don't like me too much... Oh well!"
"That creature is not of this world."
"Dragons and void beasts are beyond my aid."
"Why aren't dragons and  void beasts friendlier?"
"Do not linger here."
"Our spirits are one."
"Grant me your spirit."
"Hunters overrun the forest."
"Everyone loves sugar."
"Candy melts if not share."
"Candy calms all beasts."
"The world is a sweet place."
"Share the sweetness!"
"We all have a sweet tooth."
"Enjoy a cinnamon heart."
"Don't fret, Blue. Moss builds character."
"And how are the pebbles, Blue?"
"Blue, stunning as always."
"I'm telling you, Blue, you and Daisy would make a cute couple."
"You look just like my friend Daisy."
"Be peaceful, Brambleback."
"You know me, Brambleback."
"Don't start fights, Brambleback."
"Brambleback, remember the Kumungu affair? I still think it was your fault."
"Brambleback always has the best jokes!" Ivern giggles.
"Looking good, Brambleback."
"Brambleback, thanks for helping the beavers move their lodge."
"I'll be back soon, Scuttles."
"Poor thing, who bent your antenna?"
"You know me, Scuttles."
"Found any good crawdads lately, Scuttles? Let me know if you do!"
"Scuttles, you're a gentle crab and a scholar."
"Lord Grompulous Kevin Ribbiton of Croaksworth. I am at your service, my liege."
"You know me, Gromp."
"Gromp, ribbit, Gromp."
"Gromp, no leap races now!"
"Gromp! The epitome of frogdom."
"Top of the morning, Gromp!"
"Few understand the true spirit of the noble Krugs."
"Krugs, there's danger afoot."
"You know me, Krugs."
"Krugs, you're a boulder amongst pebbles."
"May I come near, Krugs?"
"Krugs, bring it in for a cuddle!"
"Hey, Krugs, how's the wife?"
"I loved your last story, Krugs! Really need to punch up act three, though."
"Settle down, Raptors."
"When's the last time you had your beaks sharpened?"
"You know me, Raptors."
"Have some bird seed."
"Have you heard the Crimson Raptor's singing? She's come a long way."
"Raptor friends! Looking good, guys!"
"Everyone needs to run with a wolf pack every now and then."
"Wolves hate being alone, even the lone ones."
"You know me, Wolves."
"Don't stay long, Wolves."
"No, Wolves, we're not playing fetch now."
"I told you to get that second head looked at, Wolfy."
"Always replace whatever you take."
"To take, one must first learn to give."
"Nature gives so much more than it asks for in return."
"Hurry! Get to safety!"
"I will use your essence well."
"Say hi to your spawn for me!"
"Sugar and spice, and now you're nice."
"Come back later for the second helping."
"Take some baklava for the road."
"Love makes all candy sweeter."
"We can all have cake and eat it too."
"Candy trees grow... candy apples."
"Glad you liked the treat."
"Thanks for the chocolate coins!"
"Candy is sweetness, and love!"
"I receive your power with gratitude."
"You're my boy, Blue."
"They want to take your essence! Hide!"
"Red! It's the Kumungu affair all over again!"
"Run, they seek to steal your fire!"
"Red, Code Red! Flee!"
"Thank you, brother Brambleback!"
"See you later, Red!"
"Scuttle, watch the river for me."
"Nothing escapes a Scuttle Crab's perception."
"Quick, Scuttle Crab, hide!"
"Scuttle, keep an eye on that suspicious extradimensional monstrosity, would ya?"
"Hide, Gromp, I'll find you later."
"Return to your pond, Gromp."
"Thank you, lord Gromp."
"Go in peace, friend."
"Live to finish your tale."
"Hide, Krugs, run back to your wife!"
"I treasure this essence."
"Fly along, now, danger is nigh!"
"Where did you Raptors get all this gold?"
"We'll play fetch later."
"Thank you, dear Wolves."
"Hunters on the prowl, run and hide!"
"Let me help you grow."
"Given freely to those in need."
"A gift from the forest."
"Sharing is caring—says the dung beetle."
"Be valiant, like a honeybee."
"Sometimes I need to treat myself."
"I've got two thumbs and a shield!"
"The forest protects us all."
"A gift from the forest."
"Use this gift well."
"Daisy, break up the fight!"
"Meet my friend Daisy."
"Daisy, gimme' some leaf!"
"Daisy wants to know if you'd like one lump, or two."
"Daisy, pour some sugar on them."
"Daisy's really a gum ball at heart."
"Careful, Daisy doesn't know her own strength!"
"Watch out, Daisy's really protective of me."
"Watch out, Daisy stampede!!!"
"Don't play possum! Daisy hates possums!"
"Daisy just loves to hug!"
"I think Daisy has a crush on you!"
"Thanks for playing, Daisy."
"See you later, Daisy."
"Once in a blue leaf, the earthworm will best the robin."
"Take all the gold, I really don't need it."
"This looks like it's going to grow on me!"
"I hope I don't outgrow these."
"These are so much better than the mudloafers I've been using."
"Oh, I love boots! Where do they go again?"
"Let me know if anyone tramples you."
"Nature is always watching."
"Now, I'll see them see me."
"Keep an eye out for new friends."
"Never hurts to be carefully carefree."
"A worm's eye view often turns into a bird's eye view."
"Oh, a feather-backed caterpillar!"
"Hmm? Oh, hello. Shhh. Hmm-hmm... Woohoo!"
"Dying isn't so bad—now that the dying part's over."
"The end of life is filled with life."
"Hm, this new body's a little stiff! Must be an oak!"
"Woooo! Hahow! Haha!"
"Haha! Woohoo, haha!"
"Woohoo! Haha! Ta-da!"
