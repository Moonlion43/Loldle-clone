"Nice to meet you! I'm hungry. I mean... Briar!"
"Ahh... Is this what people call 'strategy'?"
"Remember. You can choose. Don't need to cut loose right away... You. Can. Choose."
"Let's see! Today, I'm going to... Climb a tree, learn the Noxian anthem, kill my enemies, and... Oh! Make a baby laugh."
"Okay... so, I can go that way... oh, that way, or... that way. Ugh, so many choices! How do you all get anything done?!"
"Whose blood are we gonna spill today! I mean... drink. No... share? Ugh, what else do you do with blood..."
"Ah, finally. I needed a break from the city. Don't care where I'm going, as long as I'm moving."
"Ears have a nice mouthfeel. Very chewy."
"Nature's more outta control than I am!"
"Is life the hunger of death...?"
"Hmm... When people talk about their 'first language', why isn't 'body language' an option?"
"It is not polite to nibble on friends!"
"I might be a weapon, but now only I wield myself!"
"Everyone's got a pillory of their own. Mine's just on the outside."
"I don't lose control—I free myself from control."
"Aww, my hair's fading already? And I'm fresh outta blood!"
"Is 'not choosing' a choice? No... Yes! Yes."
"Argh, moving on four limbs was so much easier!"
"My teeth are bored."
"If I can taste through my nose... why can't I eat through my nose?"
"Now that I think about it... Fighters are honest, but it's the liars who start wars."
"Food doesn't have to be blood?! Ha."
"My stomach's louder than my mouth...!"
"What were the principles of strength again? Look the enemy in the eyes, hit them before they hit you, and be the last one standing...?"
"Books are magical! All I have to do is look at a bunch of squiggly lines and I become more powerful! Without any killing at all! Magic!"
"I'm not a picky eater—whether it's a splash of blood, a bloody limb, cold blood, warm blood... I'll try it all!"
"If sweaty animals are salty... does that mean there are sweet ones too? Ooh! Or sour?!"
"Today's mystery: handshakes! Why—are they testing strength or, maybe, marking each other's scents? Hmm..."
"I once heard someone say they're having 'friends' for dinner" Briar giggles madly. "And people say I'm hungry!"
"When I cut loose, I feel, hear, and see everything! I can just... be."
"Everybody wants to kill and eat, but they're all too embarrassed to do it! I'm not!"
"Feels like my hunger's always talking to me... I never understand what it's saying, but I know it's never happy."
"Hi! Is this the part where we break legs?"
"We don't have to fight! You could just... 'share' your blood!"
"You're nervous. Is it the pillory? I can take it off."
"Oh, Sion! You escaped too? And you're here... with me."
"We fight so differently, Sion—you're like 'eurrghhhh', and I'm like, 'nomnomnomnomnomnomnom'. You know?"
"Hey Talon, uh, what's the point of sneaking up on your target if they're gonna die either way?"
"Soo... You uh, you want me to call you 'Vlad' or 'Dad'?"
"BWAAAHHH! Heh, scared ya."
"Huh, never noticed how tongues just kinda... flllop around behind your teeth."
"Oh, I was supposed to laugh at that! Ehe, um-- HA HA HA HA HAA!"
"I wanna see you lose control!"
"This makes us friends!"
"Stomach's rumblin'...!"
"Who gets first bite?"
"I was made for this!"
"You like fighting too?!"
"I don't like you, Sion!"
"Ooh, Talon! Show me your blades!"
"Not sharp enough, Talon!"
"Let's compare fangs, Vlad!" Briar makes noises while holding her mouth open.
"You smile in fear, Vlad!"
"Wow, your mouth is huge!"
"Last time I licked a gromp I sneezed for days."
"Can I squeeze blood from a stone...?"
"Hold still! Gonna sharpen my teeth."
"A family-sized meal? For me?!"
"I'll fight you and your kids!"
"You protect, I attack!"
"Yes! New toothpicks!"
"You're so cute I have to eat you!"
"Scuttle right into my mouth!"
"Herald, huh? That a title, or a name?"
"Gotta work on that posture, Herald—take it from me!"
"I've always wanted a dragonskin belt!"
"Mm! I love a good pair of wings."
"Wait... you're a baron?!"
"I'm nippy when I'm hungry."
"Killing's different now... like food I can't swallow."
"Aw, dang it! Forgot to ask if I could have their blood."
"Boring Sion tastes like leather!!" Briar makes retching sounds.
"Aw, Talon... I- I'll save your blood so they can do the hemomancy thing!"
"Traitorous Talon, you chose this!!"
"Eugh, that's what you use blood for?!"
"You've become lazy, Vlad!"
"ALL THE BLOOD IS MINE!!"
"Whoa, can everybody do this?!"
"But I'm not full yet..."
"That's not my... stomach rumbling..."
"Aaaand... Still hungry."
