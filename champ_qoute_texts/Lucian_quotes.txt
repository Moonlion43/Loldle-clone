"Everybody dies. Some just need a little help."
"You don't have the heart for this."
"The Mist awaits us all. Say goodbye to whatever you care about."
"I got two guns. One's for what's in front of me, and one's for what's chasin'."
"Ain't enough bullets in the world for all the killin' I'm about to do."
"Look at 'em all. Not even knowin' they're following me to hell."
"Fight's this way. If you're coming along, try not to die."
"If I believed in something, I'd start prayin' to it right about now."
"So what was it like? All that time in the lantern?"
"A nightmare. Lotta darkness. Food was great though."
"What's to say? You're still cursed."
"Keep that up, and I'll curse you."
"So how's this gonna work?"
"Well... reckon I shoot something twice, and then you shoot it a third time."
"You been kinda... distant since you came outta that lantern. Somethin' you ain't telling me?"
"Yeah, I met someone in there. He's a ghoul. We fell in love and made ghoul babies..."
"How do you aim that thing? Isn't it heavy?"
"Not if you know what you're doing."
"'Cause I tried to... ohhhhh."
"Try to be less beautiful."
"I can turn into a screaming cloud."
"Right. I'll keep up."
"I'll sleep when they're good and dead."
"Not too many problems a shot to the head can't fix."
"Keep your guns out, and you'll never need to draw."
"No sunshine where I'm going."
"Somethin' seems too good to be true? Probably is."
"Whatever's in the beyond... I hope it's better than this."
"There's a chill in the air."
"I try to remember her the way she was... maybe it's best I don't."
"Seen so much death I don't even notice it anymore."
"You can cleanse anything... if you have the right ammunition."
"Always save one shot for myself... just in case."
"It's not the wraiths that haunt me, it's what could've been."
"How do you kill what's already dead? With a fistful of gunlight."
"Life... phew... it's a hell of a thing."
"One shot for the years we lost, one for the love we can't get back."
"Home is where I fight the dead."
"When I kill 'em, they stay killed."
"Don't need triggers, just need a target."
"If you can't run from it, you might as well shoot it."
"Some call it magic, I call it good aim."
"I can save her... I can save her..."
"People never really change... I need to believe that."
"Sentinel. Fancy word for someone with nothing to lose."
"You stare into the Mist, and the Mist stares back."
"It ain't the grave I fear... it's what crawls out of it."
"I've always fought the Black Mist... never thought I'd be married to it."
"Bravest thing I ever did, was getting up this morning."
"What we had... can still be. I know it."
"These guns run on fury. I never run out."
"My wife's eyes glow with spectral magic... I'm sure it's fine."
"Now when I hold her, she feels... cold."
"This ain't war. Wars end."
"Nothing as painful as seeing something good... go bad."
"Spend this long around lost souls, and you're bound to lose your own."
"If I'm going down, I'm taking all those bastards with me."
"Used to think nothing was colder than death, now I know different."
"How are you supposed to grieve... when the thing you mourn comes back?"
"Everyone I shoot is her captor. Everyone I save is her."
"There's a right side and a wrong side to these guns. Don't wanna be on the wrong side."
"Happiness is for other folks. Best I can hope for... is peace."
"Huh. Strange place. Beats the hell out of the Shadow Isles, though."
"No place for feelings in this line of work. A full heart's an easy target."
"So my wife is half dead. Not a problem. I'll just... love the half that isn't."
"You one'a them? Better kill ya to be safe."
"One of us finds peace. One of us walks away."
"I got two good reasons for you to turn back."
"Two guns, one you. Ain't likin' your odds."
"Came to kill some ghouls. Guess you'll do."
"Nothin' between you and me but gunlight."
"I'm just full of salvation. Come get it, friend."
"Need me to wait while you reload that thing?"
"Hey, gunslinger. I'll let you know if you hit somethin'."
"You pointin' that peashooter at me? Let's dance."
"Hey, big fella! Try drinkin' from these barrels."
"A man can get too close to his horse, y'know."
"I ain't scared'a you, Hecarim. I just hate to put a good horse down."
"Hey, pony man! You the one that left that pile over there?"
"Nothin' I like more than a horse that ain't been broken."
"Fortune. 'Fraid I can't help you outta this Harrowing."
"Let's crack you open, Mordekaiser, and see what's inside."
"Senna?! Ah, hell. If I'm gonna be shot, I'm glad it's by you."
"There she goes, the love of my life."
"Looks like we got ourselves a lovers' quarrel. Happy shootin', Senna."
"That you, Senna? Uh... is this about me not makin' the bed again?"
"Got a little somethin' for that lantern: two barrels of righteous fury."
"I haven't forgotten you, Thresh, and I sure as hell ain't forgivin'."
"'Chain Warden.' Mighty tall name for a sack of bones."
"Well, well. If it ain't the ugly low-down corpse that took my Senna."
"Thresh. You're mine."
"No. We do this together."
"Someday we'll hunt monsters together, Vayne. But today, we'll hunt each other."
"I ain't the monster you're lookin' for, Vayne, but I reckon I can be."
"The Mist has you in a bad way, friend. Let me help."
"How's Demacia? All safe from the Mist? Yeah. You're welcome."
"Lookin' for Thresh. You a friend of his?"
"If you don't have a heartbeat, you'd best not be movin'."
"Whoever made you forgot to turn off the ugly."
"I'll have no trouble killing you, and less trouble killing you again."
"We'll see how smart that mouth is when the Harrowing comes."
"Tough talk for worm food."
"This is my happy face... see?"
"No, really... I am smiling."
"Don't duck on my account."
"Sorry I gotta do this."
"Nothin's pure anymore."
"Move aside, friend."
"Yeah, I got a cure for that."
"Time to put you down."
"Here comes target practice."
"I don't do warning shots."
"How you see this goin'?"
"Ready for the beyond?"
"Nothin' left but the end."
"Gonna need more coffins."
"Hope you brought your sidearm."
"Trust me, you're better off."
"Rise again, I dare you."
"You best stay down!"
"They never get tired of dyin'."
"And all lost in darkness."
"Look at us making new memories."
"Same as the old memories."
"Sometimes, I see what the darkness is afraid of..."
"Yep. Reckon that's pure enough."
"Getting used to it."
"I was aiming at them."
"I need you alive to kiss me."
"Could see how that would be preferable."
"Reckon I could use a rest, and a break from all the screamin'."
"A Sentinel's gotta know when to let his guns cool."
"Sometimes the smart thing to do is walk the hell away."
"Time to make like a wraith, and disappear."
"Right about now, I could use some purifyin' of my own."
"It ain't ever a sin to be careful."
"Can't run from trouble... sure can delay it for a spell though."
"I'll... wait for her..."
"Purity... and... peace..."
"The shot that doesn't kill ya, sure makes you mad as hell."
"The Mist won't take me yet."
"Looks like no peace for me today."
"Saw the beyond. Didn't like it much."
"I ain't got time to die."
"Oh, someone's gonna pay for that."
"You will be purified."
"Senna... I have failed you... "
