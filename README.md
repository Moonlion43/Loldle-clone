# Loldle-clone
A Loldle-clone made entirely in python with a tkinter-GUI. The game copies the original game found on https://loldle.net/classic. 

# Installation
Simply install the Loldle-folder and run the main.py program in an IDE with the folder opened.

# Updates
I will probably be updating this game to include more than the first (and main) game in Loldle
